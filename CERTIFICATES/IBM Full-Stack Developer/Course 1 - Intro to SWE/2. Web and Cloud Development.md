# Overview

**Web Apps**
1. browser client request -> contacts server
2. server sends response to be displayed by client
Server:
- Returns:
	- HTML - structure and content of page
	- CSS - style and flair to page
	- JS - interactivity and dynamic content
- Content:
	- Static - if content is stored on server 
	- Dynamic - if content generated each time they are requested by the client
		- dynamic elements involve info coming from other systems and apps, i.e. databases
- Most websites provide both dynamic and static elements

**Cloud Apps**
- Similar to websites: request content that a server returns
- built to work seamlessly **w/ Cloud-based back-end infrastructure**
- Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other Cloud services, making them scalable and resilient

<hr>
**Webhooks** are a mechanism for **server-to-server communication** (or service-to-service communication) that enables real-time event notifications. They are about how different _applications_ talk to each other.

**Microservices** refer to an architectural style for building applications as a collection of **small, independent, and loosely coupled services** that communicate with each other through lightweight mechanisms, often APIs (like RESTful APIs over HTTP).

**"The Cloud"** refers to the **on-demand delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet.** Instead of owning and managing your own physical infrastructure, you access these resources from a third-party provider (like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure).
    - **Managed Databases (Database-as-a-Service - DBaaS):** AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL, and the provider handles backups, scaling, patching, and high availability.
    - **Serverless Computing (Functions-as-a-Service - FaaS):** Like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, where you just upload your code, and the cloud provider runs it when an event triggers it, without you needing to manage any servers.
    - **Managed Kubernetes/Container Services:** For deploying and managing containerized applications.
    - **Storage services:** Like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for highly durable and scalable object storage.

**Serverless** means that **you, as the developer or business, don't have to provision, manage, or maintain the servers.** The cloud provider handles all of that for you.
- No server management
- Event-driven execution
- automatic scaling
- Pay-as-you-go Pricing
- Focus on Code/Business Logic
<hr>

Frontend:
- client-side
- HTML, CSS, JS and related frameworks, libraries, and tools
Backend:
- server-side before code and data are sent to client
- handles logic and functionality and the authentication processes that keep data secure
- may work w relational or NoSQL databases

Developer Tools:
- code editor: Integrated Development Environment helps build and manage codes
	- Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans

# Learning Front-End Development
Creates websites and Cloud Apps that the user interacts w/

CSS: standard method to define, apply, and manage different sets of style characteristics for a website and each of its components.
- CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designs and layouts
- Compatibility on multiple devices
JS: object-oriented programming language that is used in conjunction w/ HTML and CSS to add interactivity

**Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)**
- a new front-end development lang
- extension of CSS
- allows variables, nested rules, inline imports to keep things organized
**Learner Style Sheets (LESS)**
- front-end development lang
- enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions
- Less.js is a JS tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS styles

Reactive and Responsive Design:
Reactive:
- Reactive/adapted websites display the version of the website designed for a specific screen size
Responsive:
- Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize to the device

**JS Frameworks:**
- Angular (Google)
	- allows websites to render HTML pages quickly and efficiently
	- built-in tools for routing and form validation
- React.js (Facebook)
	- JS library that builds and renders components for a web page
	- Routing not a part of framework
- Vue.js (community)
	- view layer: includes UI, buttons, visual components
	- Flexible, scalable, and integrates well w/ other frameworks.
	- Adaptable - can be a library, or it can be the framework

# Importance of Backend Developer
Creates and manages resources needed to respond to client requests
Enables server infrastructure to process request, supply data and provide other services securely

- Processes data you enter while browsing such as:
	- login info
	- product searches
	- payment info
- Write and maintain parts of the app that process the inputs

Skills/Tasks Examples:
- search requests submitted to database
	- understand web app lang
	- request database for correct data
- navigation to restricted areas
	- provide access based on user's login status
	- manage authen and authorize user account
- secure payments
	- secure data handling of sensitive info
	- secure storage of sensitive info

**APIs, routing, and endpoints:**
Front-end client interactions:
- request image
- fill out form
- input sensitive info
	these all require diff services with the backend

- **APIs, routing, and endpoints are used by back-end developers to process incoming requests**
1. APIs
	1. code that works w/ data (JSON or XML)
2. Route
	1. path to website or page
3. Endpoint
	1. API or Path
- **Back-end devs create routes to direct requests to the correct service**
- **APIs provide a way for Cloud Apps to access resources from the back-end**

**Languages:**
- JS - usually frontend
	- Frameworks:
		- Node.js
		- Express
- Python - frontend to backend
	- Frameworks:
	- Django
	- Flask

**Databases:**
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
	- to help handle requests from databases, devs use ORM to connect to databases and retrieve data
	- hides some of the complexity of querying databases

# Teamwork and Squads in SWE
How to work well as team:
- trust and respect
- define and confirm goals
- define and confirm roles
- work to each members strengths
- communication
- celebrate success and analyze problems

Examples of Teamwork in SWE
1. Kick-off meetings
2. Designs and code reviews
3. Walkthroughs
4. Retrospectives
5. Mentoring

**Squads:**
- **used in agile development**
- small team up to 10:
	- squad leader
	- product devs
	- ux devs or designers
- may practice pair programming

Benefits:
- communication and collaboration
- Talking to business and data analytics
- at least 4 people
- working alone is unsustainable long-term

# Pair Programming
- 2 devs, one comp
	- physically or virtual
- Agile development technique

Styles:
- driver / navigator
	- important to swap roles regularly
- Ping / pong
	- 1st dev writes test, 2nd dev writes code to pass test
	- swap roles regularly
- Strong style
	- Pair a junior prog w experience one
	- senior prog is nav
	- junior prog is driver
Benefits:
- share knowledge and skills
- builds soft skills
- fewer typos, logic errors, and bugs
- Code review on fly
- Identify optimal solution early on
- Overall efficiency
Challenges:
- exhausting
- personal and work commitments impacting schedule
- one person taking control
- personality clashes
- noisy environment

# Application Development Tools (p1)
A cloud app dev's workbench includes:
- **Version control**
	- keeps track of:
		- what changes were made
		- when they were made
		- who made them
	- resolves change conflicts
	- provides a way to revert to an older version
	- Git and GitHub
- **Libraries**
	- **Collections of reusable code**
		- Ex: carousel code library
	- Multiple code libraries can be integrated into a project
	- codes can be called when required
	- can solve specific problem or add specific functionalities
		- Examples:
			- jQuery: JS library that simplifies DOM manipulation
				- save development time
			- Email-validator checks if email address is correctly constructed
			- Apache Commons Proper is a repository of reusable Java components
- **Frameworks**
	- Standard way to build and deploy apps
	- Acts as skeleton you extend by adding your own code
	- Should be determined and used from beginning
	- Dictates architecture of the app
	- Calls your code
	- Allows you less control than libraries
		- but, good standardization and efficient code
	- Examples:
		- AngularJS is JS-based framework for dynamic web apps
		- Vue.js is JS framework focused on UI
		- Django is framework that uses Python for web dev

	- Inversion of Control:
		- Libraries allow you to call functions as and when required
		- Frameworks define the workflow you must follow
		- Inversion of control makes the framework extensible
		- Frameworks that heavily control the workflow is called "opinionated"
			- allow for less worrying on configuration

# Application Developer's Tools (p2)
A cloud app dev's workbench includes:
- CI/CD
	- Continuous Integration w Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment
	- ***a set of practices used in software development to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes***
	- **Enables devs to deliver frequent changes reliably**
	- Implemented through a **build-automation server**
	- **CI:**
		- ensures the code components work together smoothly
		- ***CI build environment enables you to integrate newly developed code frequently, at least every day***
		- ***CI automatically builds and tests code***
	- **CD:**
		- ***deploys the changes***
	- A cycle that allows for quick reliable changes
- Build Tools
	- **Transform source code into binaries for installation**
	- ***organize source code, set compile flags, and manage dependencies***
	- Important in environments with many inter-connected projects and multiple developers
	- **Automate tasks like:**
		- *Downloading dependencies*
		- *Compiling source code into binary code*
		- *Packaging that binary code*
		- *Running tests*
		- *Deployment to production systems*
	- Initiate build from command line or from IDE
	- 2 Categories widely used:
		- **Build-automation utilities**
			- generate build artifacts like executables by compiling and linking source code
		- **Build-automation servers** 
			- ***which execute build-automation utilities*** on a scheduled or triggered basis
	- Examples of Build Tools:
		- Webpack, a modular bundler for JS
		- Babel, a JS compiler
		- Web Assembly, a binary insturction format that runs in your browser
- Packages
	- After app developed and tested, you can deploy, but how?
	- **packages collect all necessary files and bundle them together**
	- make apps easy to install
	- are archive files that contain:
		- app files
		- instructions for installation
		- metadata you choose
- **Package Managers**
	- distribute packages
	- **take care of the tasks of finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling software packages at the user's request**
	- make working w/ packages easier
	- coordinate w file archivers to extract package archives
	- verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of package
	- Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a software repository
	- Manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed w all packages it requires
	- Examples:
		- On Linux:
			- Debian Package management System (DPKG)
			- Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)
		- On Windows:
			- Chocolatey
		- On Android
			- Package Manager
		- On MacOS
			- Homebrew
			- MacPorts
	- Cloud Application package managers
		- Libraries and utility code are manage with the cloud application package managers
		- Node.js / JS

| Node.js/JS | Java   | Ruby     | Python |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| npm        | Gradle | RubyGems | Pip    |
|            | Maven  |          | Conda  |

# Intro to Software Stacks
- Combination of technologies
- Used for creating apps and solutions
- Stacked in a hierarchy to support the app from user to computer hardware
	- higher levels provide tasks and users for user
	- lower levels interact with computer hardware
- Typically includes:
	- front-end techs
	- back-end techs

Parts of software stack:
- Presentation
- logic layer
- data layer

- Sources:
	- internal
	- 3rd party
	- cloud
- Can use: all of stack or parts of stack

Examples of software stacks:
- Python-Django
- Ruby on Rails
- ASP .NET
- LAMP
	- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
	- Early example
	- open source
	- PostgreSQL - LAPP
	- Python
- MEAN
	- MongoDB, Express.js (web-app server framework), Angular.js (front-end JS framework), Node.js (server-side scripting)
	- Platform agnostic
	- Free
	- Open source
	- **React - MERN**
	- **Vue - MEVN** (lighter weight, less capabilities, maybe better performance)
- MEVN
- MERN

Comparison of MEAN, MEVN, and LAMP:
- MEAN
	- only JS
	- open-source
	- documentation/reusable code
	- not suited to large-scale apps or relational data
- MEVN
	- Vue instead of Angular for UI
	- Vue is newer tech, not as much reusable code
- LAMP
	- open-source, lots of reusable code
	- Oldest
	- Linux OS is necessary
	- MySQL is only structured
	- backend runs on PHP, Perl, or Python, whereas frontend uses JS and HTML

Common Tools:
- Git
- GitHub
	- feature branches and pull requests
- Back-end dev:
	- JS
		- arrow functions, spread operator
	- Node.js
	- Java
	- PHP
- Front-end dev:
	- HTML, CSS, JS
	- Brackets code editor
	- VS code, IDE extensions (linting via Prettier or ESLint)
- React JS library
	- resolves cross browser issues
	- faster and more efficient than Angular
- Angular by Google
- jQuery most popular and oldest
	- used with both angular and React JS
- Node.js
	- open source
	- Making requests to web services
		- Axios library
			- create requests w/ right headers
			- provides callback fns and/or promises to be able to handle the responses that come back
		- NPM packages
			- to talk to external database
- Flask framework used on Python
- Spring java framework
- Express JS for backend:
	- scales apps quickly
	- supports caching features
	- faster page loading
