# Interpreted vs Compiled Programming Languages
What are prog langs?
- Help us tell comps what to do
- Computer language is called Machine Code
- Machines understand binary 1s and 0s
- Human-readable programming langs communicate w/ comps

Interpreted:
- Scripted or scripting lang
	- Run scripts that are repetitive and need to be run often
- **Operates thru interpreter on comp or browser**
	- **needs interpreter to be installed to run source code**
- Interpreter takes human-readable scripted code and translates to machine code
- Some interpreted langs are outdated, while some are versatile an easier to learn
- Require interpreter to translate
- Translators are built into browser or require program on comp to interpret code
- Ex:
	- JS
		- runs thru web browser interpreter
	- Python
	- Lua
	- HTML

Compiled:
- programs you run on computer
- packaged or compiled into 1 file
- usually larger programs
- **used to help solve more challenging problems, like interpreting source code**
- ***Compiled programming languages = programming languages***

- compiler program creates program file, which runs software
- program runs faster and can be done repeatedly
- source code converted from prog lang to machine code
- compiled in 1 exec file
- program runs when you select file/icon on device
- Ex::
	- C
	- C#
	- C++ (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
	- Java (well across platforms, like AndroidOS)

Compiled Programming:
- Installation Program
- Files that tell machine what to do
- Result is the compiled program
- Example:
	- OS is a compiled program

Comparing Interpreted and Compiled Languages

Compiled prog langs:
- used for more complex programs that complete larger tasks
- larger programs installed on the comp or device
- **longer time to write but code runs faster since its compiled into machine code directly onto device**
- grouped into one downloadable file

Interpreted vs Compiled:
Interpreted:
- Available across multiple platforms or in cloud
- easier
- better for websites and smaller, repeated processes
- Examples:
	- Python:
		- general-use
		- used w Windows, macOS, and Linux OSs and w/ server-side web app code
		- requires Python engine to interpret code
	- JavaScript:
		- runs on client side in web browsers
		- simple scripts run w HTML
		- complex scripts run in separate files
	- HTML:
		- uses tags to format web pages in browsers
Compiled:
- Same OS system coded in same lang
	- is compiled into same machine code language as OS system
- more difficult
- better for larger tasks, like an OS
- Examples:
	- C, C++, C#:
		- takes more time to learn and use but requires less memory and code runs faster
	- Java:
		- OOP
		- Requires JVM
		- Programming lang for Android OS
		- Cross-platform lang that runs same code on macOS, Windows, and Linux

# Query and Assembly Programming Languages
- Highlevel:
	- more sophisticated
	- use common English
	- SQL (structured query lang), Pascal (structured prog lang), Python (oop)
- Lowlevel:
	- simple symbols to represent machine code
	- Assembly langs: ARM, MIPS, X86

Query Languages:
- **query is a request for info from database**
- database searches its tables for info requested and returns results
- Important that both the user app making query and database handling the query are speaking same lang
- most prevalent database query lang is SQL
	- predefined, structured schemas
	- relational
	- others: AQL, CQL, Datalog, and DMX
	- NoSQL: 
		- non-relational
		- dynamic schemas for unstructured data

- Used for CRUD operations
- to request data from database
- Database consists of structured tables w multiple rows and columns of data

When user performs query, database:
1. Retrieves data from table
2. Arranges data into some sort of order
3. Returns and presents query results

Query statements:
- Database queries are either:
	- Select commands
	- Action commands (CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE)
- More common to use the term "statement" for commands
- select queries request data from database
- action queries manipulate data in database

Assembly Langs:
- less sophisticated than query langs, structured prog langs, and OOP langs
- uses simple symbols to represent 0s and 1s
- closely tied to CPU architecture
- each cpu type has its own assembly lang

Assembly lang syntax:
- Simple readable format
- entered one line at a time
- one statement per line
		{label} mnemonic {operand list} {;comment}
		mov TOTAL, 212   ; Transfer the value 212 in
		             ; the memory variable TOTAL

- Assembly langs are **translated using an assembler** instead of a compiler or interpreter
- One statement translates into just one machine code instruction
- Opposite to high-level langs where one statement can be translated into multiple machine code instructions

Assemblers:
- Translate using mnemonics:
	- Input (INP), Output (OUT), Load (LDA), Store (STA), Add (ADD)
- Statements consist of 
	- Opcodes that tell CPU what to do with data
	- Operands that tell the CPU where to find the data

# Understanding Code Organization Methods

- Readability, Maintainability, Configuring

    - cleaner and reliable code

    - improve code base

    - reduces bugs and errors

    - consistent and logical format of code

  

2 Methods of Organizing code: Pseudocode vs Flowcharts -

Pseudocode:

- basic high-level alg

- step-by-step sequence of solving a problem

- bridge programmer to project code

- helps programmers share ideas without extraneous waste of creating code

- provides structure that is not dependent on prog lang

  

- rough draft of program

- PROS:

    - easier review by dev groups

    - translates quickly and easily to any comp lang

    - more concise, easier to modify

    - code in diff comp langs

    - usually less than one page, unlike flowcharts

Flowcharts:

- ***pictorial representation of alg***

- ***analyze diff methods of solving a prob or completing a process***

- displays steps as boxes and arrows

- used in designing or documenting a process or program

- good for smaller concepts and probs

- provide easy method of comm about logic behind concept

- offer good starting point for project

# Branching and Looping Programming Logic

- booleans and variables are the basis of programming

Branching:

- makes decisions based on conditions

- branching statements allow program execution flow:

    - if

    - if-then-else

    - switch

        - selection control mechanism allowing value of a var or expression to change control flow of program execution via search and map

    - go-to

        - performs 1-way transfer of control to another line of code

Looping:

- continuous repetition of code until a condition is met

- while:

    - condition evaluated before loop executed

- for:

    - initial value performed once, condition tests and compares, if false is returned, loop is stopped

- do-while: 

    - condition always executed after body of a loop

  

# Identifiers

- Constants - data item whose value does not change

    - value is assigned when constant is defined

    - change constant's value once to change all instances in the code

- Variables - data value can change

    - good way to refer to unknown program items

        - username, service, filename

- Containers - reference multiple program elements

    - Arrays:

        - fixed num of elements stored in sequential order, starting at zero

        - Declare an array

            - specify data type

            - specify max num of elements

        - Syntax

            - Data type > array name > max array size

            - int my_array[50]

    - Vectors:

        - dynamic size

        - automatically resize as elements are added or removed

        - aka 'dynamic arrays'

        - Take up more memory space

        - take longer to access as not stored in sequential memory

        - Syntax

            - Container type / data type in <> / name of array

            - vector <int> my_vector

  

# Functions and Objects:

  

Functions:

- consequence of modular programming

- structured, standalone, reusable code that performs a single specific action

- Some langs refer to them as subroutines, procedures, methods, or modules

  

1. take in data as input

2. process data

3. result an output

  

Types of Functions:

- standard library functions - built-in functions

    - if, else, while, print

- User-defined functions - you write yourself

    - Once a function is written, you can use it over and over

- Blocks of code in a function are identified in diff ways

    - Use []

    - Use begin-end statements

    - Use indentations

  

Using functions

1. define function (create)

2. Call a function (invoke)

3. Declare a functions (some programming langs)

    4. (C or C++)

  

Objects:

- key to understanding OOP

- OOP is a programming methodology focused on objects rather than functions

- Objects contain data in form of properties (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods)

- OOP packages methods with data structures

    - Objects operate on their own data structure

***- consists of states (properties) and behaviors (methods)***

- Store properties in fields (variables)

- expose their behaviors through methods (functions)
