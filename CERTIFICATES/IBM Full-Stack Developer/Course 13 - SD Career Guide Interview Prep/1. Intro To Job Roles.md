Answers 3 Questions:
- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- What do you want?

Ex: "Hi, I'm Jonathan Bittmann. I'm a data analyst working toward a specialization in big data. I've spent the last six years working for a cloud development company, where I've developed my skills in programming and served as team leader. While working with some of our big data projects, I became interested in diving into that further and have gone back to school to get a big data specialization. While I'm working on that, I'm looking for a position working with data streaming and big data so I can put my learning to use. I'm very interested in the work your company does, and I think I could bring a lot of expertise and leadership to your organization. Could we meet to discuss the open roles you currently have?"

### Who are you?
Start by introducing yourself with your full name and add your preferred name if you have one. This is a good time to offer a handshake if you're in a face-to-face situation. Follow this with a statement about your career title and current situation.
### What do you do?
Provide a few key pieces of skill or experience that set you apart and make you an interesting candidate. Don't try to list your whole resume – pick a highlight or two about your recent experience. When you've decided on your points, arrange them in a way that makes sense; you want to tell a story, not just list bullet points. Making a story out of your points quickly engages your reader's or listener's interest.
### What do you want?
Finish with an action request. This could be asking for an interview, stating why you're interested in a particular position, or even asking whether your statement covers the question they were asking. The idea is to encourage the other person to engage with you, not just listen to what you've said. This will definitely depend on the context and setting, so think of a few possible endings.

###### Tips:
- use natural-sounding language
- remain professional
- understood by many people
- Practice your pitch until you are comfortable and can easily deliver it verbally. Slow down and speak clearly
- Tailor it depending on context if needed

## Drafting Basic Cover Letter
- good idea to draft basic cover letter before you start applying for work
- Adapt letter to each position and application, of course, but you can start with a basic template
- Your cover letter will work along with your resume to introduce you to a prospective employer.
- It should briefly introduce you and make a case for why you would be a strong candidate for a particular position
- include enough info to show that you are well qualified and interest the reader enough to schedule you for an interview.
- *word doc, plain text, and maybe pdf*
### Example

_Dear Ms. Ericson:_

In the first paragraph, state the title of the job to which you're applying, and
why you feel you might be a good fit. It's also sometimes useful to mention
where you saw the job listed or who referred you, and it can be very effective
if you can express why you are enthusiastic about the company.

### Example

_I was excited when my colleague Janna Navarro told me your company had an
opening for a Data Analyst 2. I have admired the products developed by Torotoni
Software for many years, and I would be very interested in joining your team. I
am a data analyst with 3 years of professional experience and skills that match
your needs, and I think I would be a strong candidate._

Next, build a case for your strengths as a candidate. Cite a few examples from
your experience that match the skills they mentioned in the job listing; draw
parallels between the listing and your resume and portfolio. Quantify your
experiences when possible. However, keep this brief and focused. Pick some best
examples and keep some of your work to discuss further when you interview.

### Example

_In my most recent role, I maintained and extended a mission-critical database
and prepared a weekly report of changes and trends for stakeholders. I also
worked with the coding and management teams to improve functionality of the
database by 45%, advised on compliance issues, and supervised the work of 2
interns. I know SQL and Python, have intermediate proficiency in Hadoop and
Apache Spark, and have used Tableau software for visualization._

Finally, close by restating your interest, say you hope to meet with them
further, and then add a polite signoff.

### Example

_Thank you for your consideration. I would love to bring my skills to Torotoni
Software, and I'm eager to discuss the contributions I can make to your team._

_Best regards,_

_Olivia Torvald_
