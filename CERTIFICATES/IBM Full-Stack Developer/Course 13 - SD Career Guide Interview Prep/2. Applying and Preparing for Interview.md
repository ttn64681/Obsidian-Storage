# Applying for a J\*b
"When you are interested in multiple positions within a company, then it's better to focus on one application. However, applying for multiple open positions can depend on several factors. One factor could be to apply first for the position you believe you are most qualified for or that interests you most. After applying, contact human resources (HR) or a hiring manager to ask for advice about whether you should apply for each job you are interested in or if it's best to avoid duplicate application submissions. T hey should be able to tell you whether your application can be forwarded or whether the company allows you to create a profile that lets you easily apply for multiple jobs."

- **Resume** – Double-check for these potential problems and any others you may spot:
	- Outdated or missing contact information
	- Grammatical and formatting errors
	- Using an unprofessional email address
	- Cliché vocabulary or jargon
	- Unrelated job experience or irrelevant hobbies
	- Attaching a photo of yourself (your resume should not contain a photo)

- **Cover letter** – Be careful to check for these issues:
	- Grammatical and formatting errors
	- Too long (multiple pages) or too brief
	- Addressing the wrong person or misspelling a name
	- Not tailoring the letter to the specific company and job opening
	- Tone is arrogant or too humble—try for a professional, confident tone
	- Listing references in the letter
	- Explaining the reason(s) why you are no longer working for your previous employer or including other issues that will be better to discuss in an interview if necessary

- **List of references** – Look out for some common mistakes applicants make with their lists:
	- Providing it too early (if it is not requested, save it for later in the screening process)
	- Failing to notify your references that they may be contacted by hiring employers
	- Providing incorrect contact information
- **Letters of recommendation** – Avoid presenting a letter with the following errors:
	- Too vague or generic content
	- Lacking information that validates your work
	- Any letter that expresses reservations, especially if it is not counterbalanced with mentioning any positive qualities
- **School/college transcripts** – Do not provide a copy of your transcripts if the hiring company has stated that you must request a sealed copy be sent directly to them by the educational institution.
- **Online portfolio's URL** – Verify that the URL is correct and that the link is valid and provides work samples that are recent and properly documented.
- **Work or writing samples** – Check for these common errors:
	- Grammatical errors
	- Does not show your work effectively
	- Clichés or overuse of buzzwords
	- Too brief or too lengthy
- **Certifications (trainings, licenses, and others)** _–_ Verify these features:
	- Valid signatures, seals, or logos are present
	- If the certificate includes an expiration date, make sure it is still current
	- Only include relevant certificates that support your academic or experiential qualifications for the job position

**Conclusion**
Remember that a cover letter is a one-time opportunity to create a first impression. In one page, you must provide information about your qualifications and career aspirations in a way that compels recruiters to learn more about how your skills and experience, and to see if your goals align with the company's own mission and goals. It is equally important to include quality content in your letter as it is to present it free from unfortunate, but very common, errors found among online job applications today. Correctness and accuracy in all of your supporting documents complete the image you project and will help you stand out from the competition.


# Technical Review Fundamentals
- Summarize technical concepts
- Define fundamental technical terms
- Prepare for technical job interviews and exams

### Reviewing Technical Concepts
- It's important to know your skills and your limitations
	- Review technical concepts
	- Study further to solidify skills
	- Consider where to expand knowledge

## SWE Fundamentals
- Concerned w/ all aspects of software production
	- from early stages of system specification to maintaining system when it's in use
	- Beyond development and production, it includes product management and development of tools, methods, and so on to support software production
	- As an engineering discipline, it uses appropriate theories and methods to solve problems w/in organizational and financial constraints
	- *Software creation process includes 3 types of activities:*
		1. Software specification
			- customers and engineers define software to be produced and the constraints on its operations
		2. Software development
		3. Software testing

## Coding Fundamentals
- Coding translates ideas from algorithm into comp lang

## Lang Fundamentals
- Programming langs simplify giving instructions to CPU
- History of langs:
	- Early langs:
		- FORTRAN, first high-level lang for complex math calculations
		- COBOL, designed around same time for business apps,
		- BASIC, general-purpose lang from early 1960s that was designed to be simple
	- C, C++
		- powerful, general-purpose langs
		- developed at Bell Laboratories in 1970s
	- C#
		- developed by Microsoft 2000
	- Java
		- developed by Sun Microsystems early 1990s
		- used to dev programs run on single computer or over Internet from web server
	- JavaScript
		- slightly later related scripting lang run in browsers only (until later)
	- Python early 1990s
	- Ruby 1990s for web servers

## Networking Fundamentals
- Knowledge about networks and networking is fundamental to modern software dev
- *Most Common Types of Networks are defined in terms of geographic area*:
	Smallest to Largest ->
	- **PAN** - Personal Area Networks
	- **LAN** - Local Area Networks
	- **MAN** - Metropolitan Area Networks
	- **WAN** - Wide Area Networks
- *Network Protocols:*
	- established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted b/w diff devices in same network
	- these rules help tell computers in network how to handle the info they receive
		- **SMTP, POP3,** provide email-services
		- **HTTP,** deliver web content in browsers
		- **DNS,** domain name translation
		- **SNMP,** network management protocol
		- **DHCP,** assign IP addresses to network devices automatically
- *Internet Protocol addressing:*
	- IP Addresses enable devices to find each other easily no matter where they are in world
		- **IPv4** - 4-byte addr format
			- used for decades and continues to be used
		- **IPv6** - 6-byte addr
			- many more devices in Internet can be addressed

## OOP Fundamentals
- style of programming based on concept of "objects"
- Objects can contain data in form of fields,  and code, in the form of procedures
- Procedures are attached to objects and can access and modify object's data fields
- Object-Oriented Programming can model complicated systems from real world into manageable software solutions
- *4 Fundamentals of OOP:*
	- **Abstraction**
		- Programmer ensures that entity will have all relevant aspects included and no extraneous ones
		- Main goal:<u> handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from user</u>
			- Enables user to implement more complex logic on top of abstraction w/o understanding about all hidden complexity
	- **Encapsulation**
		- refers to bundling data w/ methods that operate on that data
		- Main goal: <u>hide values or state of structured data obj inside a class, </u>preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them
		- Similar to abstraction, provides an appearance of simplicity that promotes efficient and effective programming
	- **Inheritance**
		- basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation
		- In most class-based object-oriented langs, an object created thru inheritance, known as a "child object", acquired all properties and behaviors of parent, w/ some well-defined exceptions
	- **Polymorphism**
		- providing a single interface to entities of diff types that may share some characteristics
		- if an instructor and student are both a kind of person, we can:
			1. write function that accepts "Person" type param
			2. then have func work on both instructor and student objects of type Person (since they both inherit from Person parent obj)

## SQL Fundamentals
- Structured Query Language is one of fundamental building blocks of modern database architecture
