<hr>

- interactive dynamic websites
- User experience

History:
- mid 1990s
- executed in browser

- Manipulate DOM
	- change content structure, and style
- Handles events
	- Interactions: button clicks to mouse mvts
	- validate form data
	- load new content
	- create visual effects
	- smooth and responsive UX
- ECMAScript 6
	- huge upgrade and improvements

Visiting Website:
- after browser HTTP request, browser downloads HTML and CSS and JS
- parses and renders HTML response first, building the render tree
- Then browser paints content w/ CSS
- Deferred JS executes and browser is ready to handle interaction
- JS RUNS IN BOTH BROWSER AND SERVER (via Node.js for server-side apps, APIs, and microservices)

How to create JS code?
- Inline:
	- </script> tag inside body, try not to do in head tag
- External:
	- link to HTML file
	- <script src="script.js"></script>

Features to see outputs in JS:
- console.log() to see outputs (F12)
- Altering DOM to dynamically change content
	- document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
- alert()
	- popup message
- confirm()
	- popup w y/n response
- prompt()
	- allows to input text


# Data types and Variables
- Initiation
- Declaration
	- var, let, const
		- lets you reserve space in memory
	- var - function-level scope
		- its available in whatever nearest parent function its in
	- let - block-level scope { }
		- cannot be re-declared in same block
	- const - cannot reassign it, block-level scope
- Variables:
	- Start: Letter, underscore, $
	- Contain: letters, numbers, underscores, $
	- Case sensitive
- Datatypes:
	- classifications or categories
	- JS us dynamically typed lang so don't need to declare
		- (JS can change data during execution)
	- 2 Types: Primitive, Composite
	- Primitive:
		- string
		- integer and floating points
		- bool
		- undefined
		- null
	- Composite: hold and manage multiple values
		- Used to organize and manipulate data
		- array: list
		- object: key val

# Introduction to Functions and Types of Functions
Function:
- reusable block of code
- encapsulate and organize code
- build complex apps with it

- Function declaration:
	- function sayHello () { }

2 Types of Function:
- Non-parameterized and parameterized functions
- Non parameterized:
	- Don't require parameters to operate
	- perform tasks without input
- Parameterized:
	- accepts arguments (values passed), defined in func
	- pass values when calling functions

Paramters and arguments:
- Parameters: vars defined in function declaration
	- a, b
- Arguments: actual values passed
	- 3, 4

2 main ways of defining functions and various types of functions:
Function declaration:
- function add(a, b)
Function expression:
- const add = function(a, b);

TYPES of FUNCTIONS:
1. Named function
	1. const add = function(a, b)
2. Immediately invoked function expression
	1. (function sayHello() { console.log("hello") }) ();
		1. defined and executed immediately
		2. contains vars and private scope codes
		3. prevent global scope contamination and var conflicts
3. Arrow function
	1. const square = x => x * x;
		1. short simple functions
4. Anonymous function
	1. (a, b) => a * b;

# JS Functions and Prototypes

Creating custom objects:

```
function Car(make, model, year) {
	this.make = make;
	this.model = model;
	this.year = year;
	this.getName = function () {
		return this.make + ' ' + this.model + ' ' this.year;
	}
}

var c = new Car ('Meridian', 'Saber GT', 2012);
alert(c.getName()); // displays "Meridian Saber GT 2012"
```

- this refers to  current instance of car obj being created
- differentiates global or local instance of var

Prototypes:
- ***Defines properties and methods for all instances of the object***
- Exists for all JS objects that can be constructed w/ new keyword
- ALL OBJECTS HAVE A PROTOTYPE
- prototypes in themselves are objects

Prototypes vs Objects:
- In objects, you can't add property by calling Car.color = "red"
- Instead, you can add it via its Prototype:
	- Car.prototype.color = "red"
	- Car.prototype.getName = function() { }

- Any object that gets instantiated inherits the current state of the prototype
- Changes made to a prototype causes all objects using it to automatically inherit the new properties and functions within that prototype

Self-executing functions:
- start running immediately after having been declared
- functions and vars are isolated from the rest of the script
- can be anonymous (unnamed) function
- used to initialize data or to declare DOM elements on the page

# Arrays
- most commonly used data structure in JS
Built-in methods:
- push("orange")
- pop() - remove last element

Nested arrays: Matrices

Arrays used to:
- store items lists
- iterate through data
- implement stacks and queues
- more

Array loops:
- forEach 
- map - new array
- filter - new array
- reduce - reducer callback function that accumulates all elements into single val
	- returns reduced val

# Array Methods:
- built-in functions

- forEach 
	- modified original array
- map - new array
	- transforms data w/o modifying original array
- filter - new array
- reduce - reducer callback function that accumulates all elements into single val
	- returns reduced val
- find - returns first element that satisfies specified condition

# Hands-on Lab: Display Employee Information using Array Methods
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- **Event-driven programming:** Learn to trigger functions through button clicks for DOM manipulation.
- **Array method proficiency:** Gain expertise in JavaScript array methods (forEach, filter, reduce, find) for data manipulation.
- **Dynamic manipulation:** Understand how to create and update HTML elements within a webpage dynamically.
- **Front-end development skills:** Develop foundational skills to create interactive interfaces and manage data presentation on webpages.

Create the **displayEmployees()** function to display employees details in **employee_details.js** file.
```

1. // Function to display all employees
2. const totalEmployees = employees.map((employee, index) => <p>${employee.id}: ${employee.name}: ${employee.name} - ${employee.department} - $${employee.salary}</p>`).join('');
3.         document.getElementById('employeesDetails').innerHTML = totalEmployees;
4.   }

```
- **.innerHTML expects a single html string, so we can't just have it display the totalEmployees array**
	- **therefore after mapping each array as a string, you join them into one single html string**

- reduce() callback function has 2 params: accumulator and currentValue
- therefore the correct format to use it is as such:
	- `const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => { return accumulator + currentValue; }`

- The map method iterates through each employee in the employees array. For each employee, it constructs a string template literal `<p>${employee.id}: ${employee.name}: ${employee.name} - ${employee.department} - $${employee.salary}</p>`, encapsulated within `<p>` tags, to represent employee details.
    
- The resulting array of constructed strings is joined into a single string using join(''). This concatenation merges all the HTML-formatted employee details into one continuous string without separators.
    
- The map method stores employees' details in the variable **totalEmployees**, which shows details in the `<div>` element (with the help of an ID) displays employee information on the webpage.
# Step 4: Perform Git commands

1. Perform `git add` to add latest files and folder by writing given command in terminal in git environment.
    1. `git add --a`
- Make sure terminal should have path as follows:
    ![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-JS0101EN-SkillsNetwork/images/cd_clonedfolder_12.png)
- Then perform `git commit` in the terminal. While performing `git commit`, terminal can show message to set up your `git config --global` for user. name and user.email. If yes, then you need to perform `git config` command as well for `user.name` and `user.email` as given.
     `git config --global user.email "[you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com)"`
1. `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
2. `git commit -m "message"`
3. `git push origin`

- After the push command, the system will prompt you to enter your username and password. Enter the username for your GitHub account and the password that you created in the first lab. After entering the credentials, all of your latest folders and files will be pushed to your GitHub repository.

# JavaScript API
Common APIs,
Common script functions and properties that are used when working w/ HTML pages


| Document                    | Element           | Window      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| document.getElementById(id) | element.innerHTML | window.open |
| .getElementsByTagName(name) | .style            | .onload     |
| .createElement(name)        | .setAttribute     | .scrollTo   |
| .appendChild(node)          | .getAttribute     |             |
| .write()                    | .removeAttribute  |             |
Retrieving a Node Reference
- getElementById to:
	- pass id val as argument
	- return one specific HTML or XML element that is based on id attribute in node
- .getElementByTagName
	- retrieve NodeList of elements with specified tagName
	- NodeList:
		- contains array of elements in doc
		- tagName parameter is the literal name of the HTML tag

Adding node to DOM
- functions can be used to place elemtn i appropriate location
- insertBefore, appendChild, replaceChild

Modifying an element's content
- element.innerHTML
	- retrieve or sets the contents within an HTML element
	- ***Returns all child elements as a text string***
	- Allows content change of an HTML element
	- browser parses html string

Modifying inline style (overrides CSS style sheet w one specific style)
- element.style
	- retrieves or sets inline CSS style for particular element
	- element.style.propertyName = value
- element.setAttribute('style',attrValue)
	- wipes out all previously set inline CSS styles

Window object methods and events:
- window.open(url, name, [features, replace])
	- returns reference to a new window object for web browser
		- name = name of window
		- features = specifies features of window, placement and dimensions
		- replace = optional Boolean value
- window.onload
	- used to start a function after page is loaded
	- window.dump("message")
		- writes string to console for browser
	- window.scrollTo(x-val, y-val)
		- Scrolls the web browser to particular set of coords

# JavaScript APIs Reading
- An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a way for two applications to communicate with each other
- JavaScript APIs are Application Programming Interfaces that use JavaScript scripting to dynamically access and modify content.

REST Architecture:
- Representation State Transfer (REST) style is common for JS APIs
- follow CRUD paradigm: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- CRUD ops are often aliased in REST env as follows:
	- Create -> POST
	- Read -> GET
	- Update -> PUT
	- Delete -> DELETE

| Method | URL                | Description                                |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | api/customer       | Create a new banking customer              |
| GET    | api/customers/{id} | Retrieve the information of a customer     |
| PUT    | api/customers/{id} | Update information for a specific customer |
| DELETE | api/customers/{id} | Delete a banking customer                  |
GET - JSON or XML response
## Document Object Model (DOM) API
- most basic JS APIs available. connects web pages to scripts by representing structure of doc (e.g. HTML web page) in memory, making it accessible for modification as required

## XMLHttpRequest
- A popular JavaScript API is XMLHttpRequest (XHR), which allows you to retrieve data without refreshing the entire page.
- XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX) programming. 

# Client-Side JS: with HTML

Client side script:
- program that accompanies an HTML doc or may be embedded directly in it
- runs when doc loads, link is activated, or button clicked
- Other scripting langs can be used

Scripts in HTML:
- offers authors a means to extend HTML docs in highly interactive ways:
	- runnign after HTML doc loads
	- validating forms and processing input as it is typed
	- Being triggered by events that affect a doc
	- Creating graphical and other doc elements in an HTML page dynamically

<noscript/> tag handles when scripts have been disabled

Scripts that are tied to intrinsic events:
- Scripts are executed every time a specific event occurs on page
- Calling function when an event occurs is called event binding

| Event           | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| onload = script | after window loads                   |
| onclick         |                                      |
| onmouseover     |                                      |
| onfocus         |                                      |
| onkeyup         | when key is released over an element |
| on submit       |                                      |
| onselect        | when text is selected in text field  |
<button type="button" onclick="showAnswers()">Show Solution
	<script>
		function showAnswer() {}
	</script>
</button>

JavaScript best Practices:
3:
1. Use IDEs, VSCode or Webstorm
2. Use linters (not ES6 standards, but team)
3. learn paradigms and patterns (how to modularize code, structure code easier for unit tests)

- Use linters like XO
- TypeScript
- ***Avoid declaring global vars and functs***
	- avoid risk of name collision if you include code from third party libraries on same page
- Place code at bot of page
- Declare vars outside of lengthy statements
- Optimize loops
- comment important sections

## Hands on JS Event Triggering Form Validation:
`username.focus()` - focuses on text input
<form id="form1" onsubmit="return checkdata()"/>

# Client-Side JS: with DOM
Define DOM hierarchy
Define DOM objects common

DOM programming Interface:
- **the programming interface between HTML or XHTML and JS**
- DOM is a browser-based interface for apps and scripts
- JS used DOM to access and modify web page elements in the web browser

World Wide Web Consortium released 4 levels of DOM specifications, each one providing more features

Implementation standards:
- Each browser has various levels of compatibility with the DOM standard
- Each DOM levels provide detailed set of feats
- Our focus is on DOM Level 1 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML APIs to access HMTL elements
- JS engine in most web browsers fully supports DOM level 1

Basic DOM model for browser:
1. WINDOW - Controls env that contains doc
	- Global Object
	- alert(0), confirm(), prompt()
2. HISTORY - internal details about recent history of pages in browser
	1. allows to simulate clicking back or forward buttons
3. LOCATION - contains information about URL of page
4. NAVIGATOR- object representation of client Internet browser. no standard... property values returned are not consistent across browsers
5. SCREEN - dimensions and info
6. DOCUMENT - HTML docs loaded into a window become doc obj

![[Pasted image 20250717163837.png]]
HTML Doc Object Diagram
1. DOCUMENT

2. DOCTYPE
Element Nodes:
3. HTML
	1. HEAD
		1. META
		2. TITLE
	2. BODY


![[Pasted image 20250717163855.png]]
DOM level 2 tree for form:
1. FORM

2. TEXTNODE "\n"
3. P
	1. TEXTNODE "\n"
	2. INPUT
	3. TEXTNODE "\n"

# JS DOM Objects
- List related node types
- Show how to access doc elements
- Explain object naming

DOM level 2 nodes include 12 tpes, but only 7 are HTML related:
1. Element
2. Attribute
3. Text
4. Comment
5. Document
6. Document Type
7. Fragment
![[Pasted image 20250717164225.png]]
Dom level 2 properties:
node object properties:
**![[Pasted image 20250717164402.png]]**

Accessing Document Elements:
When doc loaded:
- Browser creates arrays for forms, images, anchors, links, applets, and embeds
- Places all objects into arrays
	- Arrays indexed and start at zero
	- e.g. document.images[0]

![[Pasted image 20250717165549.png]]
Element field 1 can be referenced by:
		- document.forms[0].elements[0]
		- document.forms["form1"]
		- elements["field1"]
		- document.form1.field1

Object naming:
- ID attr:
	- Identifies an element in doc
	- Refers to element w name that matches val of id attr
	- must be unique
	- cannot start with numerio=c digit
- getElementById

```

practical experience with methods such as `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `removeChild()`

- createElement()
	- returns HTML element
	- you can keep appending to this element
- appendChild()
	- you can append inline elements like span, button, etc.
- removeChild()
	- remove a reference to an HTML element, including the created element

# More JS Logic

```js
if(isNaN(user_input)) console.log("Invalid input");
```

# Module Summary

In this module, you learned that:

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables developers to add dynamic content to web pages.
    
- JavaScript variables are declared using the 'var', 'let', or 'const' keywords and take their type from the value assigned.
    
- JavaScript arrays are data structures used to store and organize collections of values.
    
- Arrays can contain various data types, such as numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays.
    
- JavaScript uses blocks of code, called functions, that can be called from anywhere in the script.
    
- New methods and properties can be added to an object by modifying the prototype for that object.
    
- Prototypes allow you to define properties and methods for all instances of a specific object.
    
- Client-side scripts are programs that accompany HTML documents and are used by developers to incorporate more interactive elements.
    
- The script tag can incorporate a script within an HTML document or call a script from an external file.
    
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the programming interface between HTML or XHTML and JavaScript.
    
- Developers can access HTML DOM elements from JavaScript scripts using the correct DOM notation.
    
- APIs are often used to access HTML DOM elements in web pages.
