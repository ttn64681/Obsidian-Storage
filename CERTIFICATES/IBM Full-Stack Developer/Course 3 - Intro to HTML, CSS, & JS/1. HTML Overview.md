<hr>

HTML:
- lang of Internet
- designed to originally share scientific docs
- adapted to suit requirement for displaying various types of docs as web pages

elements:
- tags used by browser to render content

Evolution of HTML:
- 1990: introduced by CERN (EU Org for Nuclear Research) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
- 1995: HTML 3
- 1997: 3.2
- 1997: 4.01
- 2000: XHTML 1.0
- 2007: HTML 5
	- W3C and WHATWG started collaborating with each other to create HMTL5 since
- 2016: HTML5.1 

Objectives of HTML5:
- defines single lang which can be written in **HTML or XML syntax**
- Interoperability w/ earlier HTML implementations
- Improves **markup** for docs
- Includes markup and APIs for idioms, such as web apps

HTML and HTML5 are used interchangeably


# HTML Features
Features:
Allows for enhanced multi-platform development

- Docs having text/html media type are parsed using HTML rules
- Docs transmitted w/ an HTML content type is processed as an HTML doc by web browsers

<!DOCTYPE html> 
- declaration tag that represents the doc type
- instructs web browser about version of HTML
- should be first line of HTML code
\<html> - 
- Root element of tree
- Contains all HTML elements except <!doctype> tag
\<head> 
- contains:
	title
	script
	style
	link
	meta
	base - browser support info and other initialization functions

**DOM Tree**: ***in memory representation of document via nodes***
- Several types of Nodes:
	- DOCTYPE node, elements such as headers and paragraphs, text nodes, and comment nodes
	- 

Differentiate b/w XML vs HTML:
XML: Extensive Markup Lang (looks sorta similar to HMTL)
\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=ISO-8859-1
 />

- XML processor parses the document

Which one to Use?
- choice is based on how you intend to use the app

are you using XSLT to create other documents and resources for webpages?

| XHTML                                                                                       | HTML                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tags need to be in lowercase                                                                | Case used doesn't matter                                                       |
| Codes must be well-formed                                                                   | Unmatched quotation marks, non-terminated and uncontained elements are allowed |
| XML parser will stop processing if it encounters a situation where syntax isn't well-formed | Syntax is less rigorous than XHTML syntax                                      |

# HTML Management and Support
HTML5 Key Themes:
- syntax is compatible w HTML4 and XHTML1 docs
- supports elements and attributes of earlier specifications for user agents
- removes several elements and attributes to simplify lang for authors
- Includes elements and APIs that help in creating web apps
	- video and audio elements
	- API for drag and drop
	- ***API that supports offline web apps***

What makes HTML suitable for creating web apps
	Modern browsers support full range of HTML5 feats
	APIs enhance user experiences, such as advanced animation, drawings, audio, and video elements
	Use of HTML and CSS improves page load time
	SEO uses keywords provided by meta tags for Google and other search engines
		<meta name="keywords" contents="coding, html production, css"/>

HTML5 elements
- structural elements help logically define page structure
	- section, article, header, footer, figure, and figcaption
- APIs help w graphics and embedded content
	- canvas, audio, and video
- Input elements can automatically be validated by the browser
	- tel, email, datetime, number, range, and color
- Web storage APIs can store data in browser
	- localStorage, sessionStorage
- ***Web workers run processing-intensive tasks without blocking the user interactions to the current page***

# HTML Scripting
- form validation
- dynamic content changes
- image manipulation
(Can be turned off) - use but don't rely on JS....

Enabling scripting:
- Scripting is enabled in browser context when the following conditions apply:
	- browser supports scripting
	- user has enabled
	- browser context does not have sandboxed browsing content flag set

Enabling scripting - iframe
- Grants the embedded obj the same perms as the page
- **Allows ads to occur in application**
	- **to prevent granting implicit perms to embedded objects:**
		- Use sandbox attribute on any tag that contains an embedded obj
		- <iframe src="" sandbox> </iframe>

HTML document API-DOM tree accessors
- Every HTML and XML doc is represented by a doc obj
- can be accessed via script
- DOM tree accessors are HTML doc APIs that provide access to all the HTML elements on a page
- Property to access the HTML elements is prefixed by the world doc
document.head - returns head element
document.title - sets or returns title of doc
document.images - returns HTMLCollection of the img elements in doc
document.lastModified - returns date of last mod to doc
document.scripts - returns HTMLCollection of script elements in doc

HTML doc API - DOM tree methods:

| getElementById('id')        | Accesses first element w specific id                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| getElementsByTagName('tag') | Returns nodelist of all elements with the specificd HTML tag name  |
| open()                      | Opens an output stream to collect the output from document.write() |
| write()                     | Write JS code to the doc                                           |
| close()                     | closes the output stream prev opened w document.open()             |
# HTML5 Browser support

some browser do not fully support all HTML5 and CSS3 capabilities
New browser version are continually added with support for HTML5 feats
- Google Chrome supports most feats

Verifying HTML5 browser support using JS
- Create DOM element using document.createElement()
	- creates element regardless of whether the browser supports it or not
- Check the DOM object for known property or method
	- The browser displays the support element
- Set type value for input elements
	- the browser displays the supported element
	- Otherwise, browser returns input type="text" and displays a regular text field by default

Use dev tools in browsers to debug html css
Add fallback mechanisms for browser that do not support new features like downloading
- instead add link

Frameworks:
- Bootstrop has prowerful cross browser capabilities
- Foundation has a significiant learning curve
- Materialize has an optimized feature set
- UIkit is popular is iOS dev

In this module, you learned that:

- HTML provides the basic structure and content for a website using tags. 
    
- Tags represent the elements of an HTML page. 
    
- The HTML DOM Tree describes how a website is structured. 
    
- HTML uses APIs to enhance the user experience, providing features for advanced animation, audio, and video. 
    
- Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites. 
    
- It is recommended to not rely on scripting as it can be disabled. 
    
- HTML5 sandboxes help manage iframe mashups.  
    
- HTML5 Browser Support Tables describe which browsers support which HTML5 features. 
    
- JavaScript is used to check if an element is supported by a browser. 
    
- CSS provides consistent style and design throughout the website. 
    
- There are two types of CSS layouts to design websites: fluid and fixed.


# Glossary: HTML5 Overview

| **Term**             | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOM Tree**         | "Document Object Model" is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.                                  |
| **XML**              | An "eXtensible Markup Language" Designed to store and transport data allowing users to define their own markup languages, primarily to display documents on the web. |
| **XHTML**            | An "eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language" similar to HTML but with stricter formatting rules.                                                                        |
| **Web Storage APIs** | APIs that allow data storage in a browser.                                                                                                                           |
