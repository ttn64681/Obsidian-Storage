# What is Microsoft?
- multinational computer technology corporation
	- makes software, phones, tablets, game consoles, cloud services, a search engine and more!
	- best known for **Windows OS**
- headquartered in Redmond, Washington

# What is Azure?
- Microsoft's Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

# Azure's Deployment Models
<hr>
## Public Cloud
- Everything built on Cloud Provider
- Everything running on "Azure"
- aka Cloud-Native
![[Azure Network Arch Diagram.png]]
## Private Cloud
- Everything built on company's datacenters
- aka On-Premise
- The cloud could be some opensource mimic, like OpenStack
![[Private Cloud Arch Diagram.png]]
## Hybrid
- Using both On-Premise and a Cloud Service Provider (connected together)
- Networking Services to facilitate connection b/w the 2
	- e.g. ExpressRoute (dedicated connection, like fibre-optic line running from on-prem datacenter to azure network)
![[Hybrid Deploy Model Arch Diagram.png]]

## Pros and Cons
![[Azure Deploy Models Pros and Cons.png]]

## Cross Cloud
- multiple cloud providers

# Total Cost of Ownership
<hr>
- calculation that quantifies total cost *(purchase, deployment, operation, and maintenance)* of a product or service over its entire lifecycle
- **2 Types of Costs:**
## 1. Capex (Capital Expenditure) - On-Prem
- **refers to long-term investments in physical assets (property + equipment)**
- *Spending money upfront on physical infra*
- software license fees
- Cons:
	- bunch of costs
	- You have to guess upfront what you plan to spend
## 2. Opex (Operational Expenditure) - Azure
- **refers to day-to-day expenses of running a business**
- *Costs associated w/ on-premises datacenter that has shifted cost to service provider*
- subscription fees
- **SAVE 75%**
- You can try a product or service w/o investing in equipment


# Cloud Architecture Terms
<hr>
- **Solutions Architect**
	- *Role in tech org that architects a tech solution using multiple systems via researching, documentation, experimentation*
		- guide development
		- focus on big picture
		- ensure long-term success
		- design blueprint

- **Cloud Architect**
	- *A **solutions architect** that focuses on solutions using cloud services*
	- Need to understand these terms, and factor them into their designed arch based on business requirements:
		- Availability - ability to ensure service remains available
		- Scalability - ability to grow rapidly
		- Elasticity - ability to shrink and grow to meet demand
		- Fault Tolerance
		- Disaster Recovery

- A Solution Architect needs to always consider the following business factors:
	- **How secure is solution?**
	- **How much is this going to cost?**


## a) High Availability
- ability for service to remain avaiable by ensuring there is **NO single point of failure** and/or ensure a certain level of performance
![[high availability diagram.png]]
### Azure Load Balancer
- evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers ->
	- either in a single data center **Local Load Balancers**
	- or across multiple data centers **Global Load Balancers**
- *if datacenter OR server becomes unavailable, the load balancer routes traffic to ONLY AVAILABLE datacenters w/ servers*

- running workload across multiple **availability zones** *(aka datacenters)* ensures that *if 1 or 2 AZs become unavailable, your service/apps remains available*
	- common to run 3 servers across 3 datacenters

## b) High Scalability
- **ability to increase/decrease your capacity (resources & services) based on increasing/decreasing demand of traffic, mem, and computing power**
### 1. Vertical Scaling
- Upgrade to bigger server
### 2. Horizontal Scaling
- Add more servers of same size

## c) High Elasticity
- ability to **auto** increase/decrease your capacity (resources & services) based on current demand of traffic, mem, and computing power
	- (Auto scaling)

- dynamically add or remove VMs
- **achieved via Horizontal Scaling**
	- generally not Vertical, too difficult, could lose data
### i. Done via Azure VM Scale Sets
- Auto increase/decrease in VMs in response to demand or a defined schedule
- Similar to VMware vSphere platform and vCenter server (management interface):
	- (except w/in private cloud or data center instead)
	- Each physical host has ESXi to create VMs
		- can go into ESXi Web GUI at specific IP to manage VM's individually
	- use vCenter to manage ALL ESXi hosts and load balance vms across hosts + high availability
	- ![[Drawing 2025-12-02 12.54.45.excalidraw]]
### ii. SQL Server Stretch Database
- Dynamically stretch warm and cold transactional data from Microsoft SQL Server 2016 to Microsoft Azure (THIS IS RETIRED as of June 2024)


## d) Highly Fault Tolerant
- ability for service to ensure there is NO SINGLE point of failure. Preventing chance of failure
- **Fail-overs** is when you have a plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case primary system fails
![[Pasted image 20251202141527.png]]

- *common ex:* stand-by secondary
	- having copy (secondary) of database where all ongoing changes are synced. 
	- The secondary system not in-use until fail over occurs (hardware issue maybe) and it becomes the primary database

- You can use **Azure Traffic Manager** for highly-fault tolerant system: (DNS-level)
	- DNS-based traffic balancer to fail-over from a failing primary system to stand-by secondary system
		- for *global-traffic* distribution and *cross-regional* disaster recovery
- You could also use a Load Balancer
	- **Azure Load Balancer** is for distributing traffic w/in *single region*


## e) Highly Durable
- ability to recover from a disaster and prevent loss of data.
- Solutions that recover from a disaster is known as Disaster Recovery (DR)
- *Questions to ask:*
	- Do you have a backup?
	- How fast can you restore that backup?
	- Does your backup still work?
	- How do you ensure current live data is not corrupt?


# Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
- to know more about disaster recovery, we need to know more about bcp

- BCP is a document that outlines how a business will continue operating during an unplanned disruption in services





# Terms
<hr>
## Cloud
- Horizontal Scaling - more servers
- Vertical Scaling - better, more expensive servers w/ more storage and capacity
- IaaS - 
	- Provides virtualized resources (VMs, storage, networks)
	- You have to configure the OS, middleware, and apps yourself
		- e.g. migrating app server to cloud
- PaaS - 
	- Provides the platform for running and managing apps + hardware
	- You have to provide the code and data
		- e.g. deploying web app
- SaaS -
	- Provides the app and everything behind it, infra, resources, hardware, etc
	- You just use the product
		- e.g. using email service via web or cli
## Azure
- Azure VM Scale Sets - IaaS to deploy and manage group of 

## Networking
- TCP/UDP - **transport protocols**, "pipes" that move data
	- TCP: reliable and connection-oriented (web-browsing, email)
	- UDP: faster but connectionless (real-time apps, online gaming, streaming)
- TLS/SSL - **security protocols**, encrypt data for privacy & integrity
	- TLS: successor to SSL, more secure
	- they operate on TOP of TCP/UDP to provide security
- TCP + TLS/SSL = HTTP using TCP transport, w/ TLS to encrypt data passing through TCP
