# What is it?
- The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

## On-Prem
- You own servers
- You hire IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all risk
## Cloud Providers
- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
- You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

# Evolution
## Dedicated Server
- one physical machine to single business
- single app/site
- expensive, high maintenance, high security
- purchasing
## Virtual Private Server (VPS)
- one machine to single business
- split into sub machines (virtualized)
- runs multiple web apps/sites
- better utilization and isolation of resources
- purchasing
## Shared Hosting
- one machine shared by hundred of business
- relies on tenants under-utilizing their resources
- no submachines, but a folder with permissions you could use
- very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation
	- one person could use up the server more, hanging up resources, hanging the server

## **Cloud Hosting**
- multiple physical machines act as one system
- system abstracted into multiple cloud services
- flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective, high-configurability
- cloud still includes the previous types of hosting, but now you can select

# Common Cloud Services
<hr>
- there are hundreds of cloud services, grouped into various types
- 4 most common:

## Compute
- virtual computer to run app, programs, code
	- *Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine*
## Storage
- virtual hard-drive to store files
	- *Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage*
## Networking
- virtual network to define internet connections or network isolations
- **VPC**
	- define virtual routes and switches that direct traffic b/w virtual servers (compute), databases, and storage.
- **Virtual Firewall**
- **Internet Gateways**
- **VPN Connections** (secure, encrypted tunnel b/w on-prem network and cloud VPC)
- *Amazon VPC, Azure VNet, Google Cloud VPC*
## Databases
- virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-app
- **provides scalable database**
- **specialized service built ON TOP of Compute and Storage**
	- Compute: provides vm to run database engine
	- Storage: holds the data
- *Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL, NeonDB*
# "Cloud Computing" as a "Catch-All" Term
- can be used to refer to all 4 of those categories, even though it has "compute" in the name
