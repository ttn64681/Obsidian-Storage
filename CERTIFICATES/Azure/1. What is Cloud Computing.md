# What is it?
<hr>
- The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

## On-Prem
- You own servers
- You hire IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all risk
## Cloud Providers
- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
- You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

# Evolution
## Dedicated Server
- one physical machine to single business
- single app/site
- expensive, high maintenance, high security
- purchasing
## Virtual Private Server (VPS)
- one machine to single business
- split into sub machines (virtualized)
- runs multiple web apps/sites
- better utilization and isolation of resources
- purchasing
## Shared Hosting
- one machine shared by hundred of business
- relies on tenants under-utilizing their resources
- no submachines, but a folder with permissions you could use
- very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation
	- one person could use up the server more, hanging up resources, hanging the server

## **Cloud Hosting**
- multiple physical machines act as one system
- system abstracted into multiple cloud services
- flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective, high-configurability
- cloud still includes the previous types of hosting, but now you can select

# Common Cloud Services
<hr>
- there are hundreds of cloud services, grouped into various types
- 4 most common:

## Compute
- virtual computer to run app, programs, code
	- *Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine*
## Storage
- virtual hard-drive to store files
	- *Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage*
## Networking
- virtual network to define internet connections or network isolations
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** 
	- define virtual routes and switches that direct traffic b/w virtual servers (compute), databases, and storage.
- **Virtual Firewall** to control traffic flow b/w VMs
- **Internet Gateways**
- **VPN Connections** (secure, encrypted tunnel b/w on-prem network and cloud VPC)
- *Amazon VPC, Azure VNet, Google Cloud VPC*
## Databases
- virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-app
- **provides scalable database**
- **specialized service built ON TOP of Compute and Storage**
	- Compute: provides vm to run database engine
	- Storage: holds the data
- *Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL, NeonDB*

# "Cloud Computing" as a "Catch-All" Term
- can be used to refer to all 4 of those categories, even though it has "compute" in the name


# **Benefits of Cloud Computing**
<hr>

## Cost-Effective
- Pay for what you consume
- generally no upfront costs 
	- (no need to purchase expensive physical servers, networking equipment, data centers, etc.)
- Pay-as-you-go
- thousands of customers sharing the cost of resources
	- cloud providers build massive infrastructures
	- high costs of building and maintaining is spread across countless customers

## Global
- launch workloads anywhere in the world, just choose a region

## Secure
- cloud provider takes care of physical security
- cloud services can be secure by default or give you ability to configure access down to granular level

## Reliable
- data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, fault tolerance
	- **high-availability features:**
		- solutions that continuously monitor health of physical hosts, allowing VMs to automatically restart on diff host
	- **fault tolerance:**
		- solutions that maintain live copy of VM on separate host to take over if needed
	- **distributed architectures:**
		- your apps are typically spread across multiple physical servers

## Scalable
- Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand

## Elastic
- **Automate scaling** during spikes and drop in demand

## Current
- the underlying hardware and managed software is **patched, upgraded and replaced by cloud provider w/o interruption to you**
- there are cases of interruption, but generally less cases than on-prem


# Types of Cloud Computing
<hr>
## SaaS (Software as a Service)
- product is run and managed by service provider **(The app product itself)**
	- *Don't worry about how service is maintained*
	- It just works and remains available by the SaaS provider

- *Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce*

	**User manages:** nothing
	**Provider manages**: EVERYTHING - the app, OS, software updates, infra...
## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Focus on **deployment** and **management** of your apps **(for devs to deploy/manage apps)**
	- *Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding hardware or OS or infra under-the-hood*

- *Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service (deploy web apps, REST APIs, movile backends)*

	**User manages:** Running app/code, data storage.
	**Provider manages:** 
## **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- (basic building blocks for Cloud IT)
- Focus on managing OS, installation of softwares, data, **(for admins)**
- <span style="background:#fff88f">On-demand access to virtualized computing resources</span> like networking features, computers and data storage
	- (Virtual servers, virtual storage, virtual networks)
	- *Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware*
- IaaS can have PaaS and SaaS on top of it

- *Microsoft Azure (Azure Virtual Machines), AWS (EC2), Oracle Cloud (Infrastructure Compute), Google Cloud Platform (Compute Engine)*

	**User manages:**
	**Provider manages:** VMs, Physical Hardware for storage, compute, networking

**The further right, the less responsibility you have (the more the cloud provider manages)**

Notes:
- **Virtualization:**
	- software layer that transforms physical hardware (servers, storage, networking) into virtual resources (like virtual machines, virtual disks, virtual networks)
	- On-Prem:
		- you manage the hypervisor and virtual infra (setting up, config, maintain, and troubleshoot all components)
		- **Hypervisor:** (Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM) 
			- software layer that sits directly on top of physical server hardware
				- replaces OS
			- **Job: Create and run VMs w/ OS and resources.** Virtualizes physical hardware (CPU, mem, storage, network) and allocates these virtual resources to each VM
			- Allows multiple OSs and apps to run concurrently and in isolation on a single physical machine
			- Ex:
				- VMWare ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, Xen
- **Runtime:**
	- software env for app code to be executed
		- (e.g. JVM, .NET runtime, Python interpreter, Node.js engine)
- **Middleware:**
	- this is software that acts as bridge b/w OS and apps, enabling communication, data management, and services, or platform for apps to run
	- Ex:
		- **Web Servers:** Apache, HTTP Server, Nginx (handle HTTP reqs, serve static content, proxy requests to app servers)
		- **App Servers:** Apache Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly, WebLogic (provide runtime env for enterprise apps)
		- **Message Brokers/Queues:**
			- RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka (enable async comms b/w diff parts of an app)
