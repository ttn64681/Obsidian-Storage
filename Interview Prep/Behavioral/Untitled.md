### Interactive Activity: STAR Outline Practice (12 mins)**

- **Goal:** Practice breaking down _your own_ experiences into the STAR format in a low-pressure way.
    
- **Instructions:**
    
    1. Look at these 3 common questions:
        
        - "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved on a project."
            
        - "Describe a time you had to quickly learn something new for a project or task."
            
        - "Tell me about a time you took initiative or demonstrated leadership."
            
    2. **Choose ONE question.**
        
    3. **(5 mins) Individual Work:** On paper or a doc, quickly jot down bullet points for the S, T, A, and R of a personal story that answers your chosen question. Just the outline!
        
    4. **(7 mins) Volunteer Sharing (Optional & Low Pressure):** "Does anyone feel comfortable sharing just their _outline_ (the bullet points) for one of the questions? We can discuss how the STAR structure helps organize the story."
        
- **Why this works:** Allows individual reflection. Sharing the _outline_ is less intimidating than telling the whole story. Focuses on the structure.
