# Big O and Data Structures
Big O - notation used to measure an algorithm's efficiency as input size (n) grows.
1. Time Complexity: How long does algo take as input (n) grows bigger?
2. Space Complexity: How much mem does algo use as input (n) grows bigger?

O(n) :
	`for item in my_list:`
O(logn) :
