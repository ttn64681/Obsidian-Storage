- Programmable logic device
- **Structured** scheme for implementing combinational logic circuits
- Consists of a **set of programmable AND gate planes** linked to a **set of programmable OR gate planes**
- PLA allows for a large number of logic functions to be synthesized in the SOP and POS canonical forms

- Use the PLA to implement the circuit:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |

- **NO carry input**
- **XOR** gate to generate SUM
- **AND gate to generate Carry (C)**
- **generates 1 single bit**

![[Full Adder (FA).png]]

- **XOR** of 3 inputs (A, B, C_in) to generate SUM
- **Minterm SOP to generate C_out**
- **generates 1 single bit**

### How is this used to create 32-bit Adder?
- Ripple Carry Adder
## Ripple Carry Adder
![[32 bit adder divided in 4.png]]
![[Ripple Carry Adder.png]]
- this is known as a Ripple Carry Adder
![[Ripple-Carry Adder.png]]
## Decoder
![[Decoder.png]]
![[Decoder For Example.png]]
- Decodes all possible amount of outputs
## Decoder Example
![[Decoder Example.png]]


## Encoder

## Encoder Example

## Priority Encoder
![[Priority Encoder.png]]
- ignores low-priority input signals
## Priority Encoder Example
![[Priority Encoder Example.png]]

## Code Converter
- **Used to convert an n-bit number into another n-bit number**
- **Implemented as a decoder-encoder combination**
- e.g. Y = (X + 3) mod 8 where Y and X are 3-bit numbers

| X_2 | X_1 | X_0 | Y_2 | Y_1 | Y_0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |

## Multiplexers
![[REPO/2025 FALL/CSCI 4720/2 - Logic Design/Pasted Images/Multiplexers.png]]
- 4 input -> 1 output

![[Multiplexer ex.png]]
- Acts like a "data combiner"
- takes many separate data streams and combines them onto single wire to save space

## Demultiplexer (DEMUX)
![[Demultiplexer.png]]
- Acts like a "data separator"
- takes single combined data streams and spits out original separate destinations
![[Demultiplexer ex.png]]

## Multiplexers and Demultiplexers for Communication:
Route Example:
![[Route Example.png]]
### Usefulness:
- **Saving Wires:**
	- Imagine have 8 sensors, and want to send their data to cpu
	- instead of 8 separate wires
- **Resource Sharing:**
	- in cpu, allow single internal data path (data bus) to be shared by many different sources/destinations
	- chip design is simpler + more efficient
