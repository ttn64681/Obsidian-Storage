- Programmable logic device
- **Structured** scheme for implementing combinational logic circuits
- Consists of a **set of programmable AND gate planes** linked to a **set of programmable OR gate planes**
- PLA allows for a large number of logic functions to be synthesized in the SOP and POS canonical forms

- Use the PLA to implement the circuit:

- Number of ANDS = Number of non-repeated minterms
	- 7
- Number of ORs = Number of functions
	- 3

EX: 4 Inputs F=(A,B,C,D) -> Output: Number of 1 bits X,Y,Z
