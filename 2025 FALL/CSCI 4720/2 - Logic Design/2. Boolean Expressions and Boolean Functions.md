- Ex: Find values of Bool function represented by F(x,y,z) = xy + z

## Minterm and Maxterm
- **Minterm:** (SUM OF PRODUCTS)
	- A minterm of n Boolean vars = term -> product of n literals in which **each var appears exactly once (in each term)**
	- *Each minterm has value of 1* for exactly one combination of values of vars
		- *this means, find 1's, do SOPs*
	- A **Boolean function can be written as** a *sum of minterms*, which is referred to as a minterm expansion or a standard sum of products
	- Ex:
		- ABC, A'BC, A'B'C', etc.
	- if boolean function has 3 vars, how many minterm vars?
		- 2^3 = 8
		- why 2? b/c of the NOT of the var
- Maxterm: (PRODUCT OF SUMS)
	- A maxterm of n Boolean vars = sum of n literals in which **each var appears exactly once**
	- *Each maxterm has value of 0* for exactly one combination of values of vars
		- *this means, find 0's, do complement of vars to do POSs*
	- **A Boolean function can be written as** a *product of maxterms*, which is referred to as a maxterm expansion or a standard product of sums
	- Ex:
		- A+B+C, A'+B+C, A'+B'+C', etc

## Sum-of-Products / Products-of-Sums Expansion
- Ex: Find the sum-of-products expansion for the function F(x,y,z) = (x+y) z'

| x     | y     | z     | x+y | z'  | T/F   |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- |
| *0*     | *0*     | *0*     | 0   | 1   | *0*   |
| *0*   | *0*   | *1*   | 0   | 0   | *0*   |
| **0** | **1** | **0** | 1   | 1   | **1** |
| *0*   | *1*   | *1*   | 1   | 0   | *0*   |
| **1** | **0** | **0** | 1   | 1   | **1** |
| *1*   | *0*   | *1*   | 1   | 0   | *0*   |
| **1** | **1** | **0** | 1   | 1   | **1** |
| *1*   | *1*   | *1*   | 1   | 0   | *0*   |
- **Minterm Answer:** x'yz' + xy'z'  + xyz'
- *Maxterm Answer:*  (x+y+z)(x+y+z')(x+y'+z')(x'+y+z')(x'+y'+z')

## Combinational Logic Circuit Design (4 Steps)
1. Functional description of the logic circuit
2. Derive a truth table
3. Derive the Boolean expression
	1. 2 canonical (standard) forms
		1. SOP form
		2. POS form
4. Derive the Logic Circuit
	1. AND-OR Implementation
	2. OR-AND Implementation

## Combinational Logic Circuit Design Example
- **Step 1: Functional Description of the Logic Circuit**
- Design EX:
	- Design 3-input combinational logic circuit to detect whether or not precisely 2 of its inputs are 1. - *Functional Description*
	- *Paraphrased functional description:* Design a combinational logic circuit that takes 3 binary inputs and outputs of 1 if and only if **exactly 2 of the inputs are 1** and **0 otherwise.**

- **Step 2: Truth Table of Logic Circuit**
2 ones exactly:

| x     | y     | z     | T/F   |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| *0*   | *0*   | *0*   | *0*   |
| *0*   | *0*   | *1*   | *0*   |
| *0*   | *1*   | *0*   | *0*   |
| **0** | **1** | **1** | **1** |
| *1*   | *0*   | *0*   | *0*   |
| **1** | **0** | **1** | **1** |
| **1** | **1** | **0** | **1** |
| *1*   | *1*   | *1*   | *0*   |
- **Step 3: Derive Boolean expression for F(X,Y,Z) in SOP form**
**Minterm answer:** (x'yz)+(xy'z)+(xyz')
*Maxterm answer:* (x+y+z)(x+y+z')(x+y'+z)(x'+y+z)(x'+y'+z')

## Combinations of Gates
- Ex: Construct circuits that produce these outputs
a. (x+y)x'
b. x'(y+z')'
c. (x+y+z)(x'y'z')


## Laws of Boolean Algebra
- Equivalence
	- 2 bool expressions are equivalent if they have same truth table
	- In boolean function, a Boolean subexpression can be replaced by an equivalent (sub)expression
- Dual Expressions
	- The dual of a Boolean expression is obtained by replacing each + by an *, each * by an +, each 1 by a 0, and each 0 by a 1
- Principle of Duality
	- If a Boolean equation is valid, so is its dual. For ex:
		- **(X+Y)' = X' * Y**' and *(X * Y)' = X' + Y'*
		- **X + 1 = 1** and *X * 0 = 0*
