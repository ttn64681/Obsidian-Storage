## Reducing Gates
- Makes it possible to construct a circuit for this function that uses the fewest gates and fewest inputs to the AND gates and OR gates in the circuit, among all circuits for the Boolean expression we are minimizing

## Advantages of Reducing Gates
- Can lead to a more reliable circuit and can reduce the cost to produce the chip
- Also, minimization makes it possible to fit more circuits on the same chip

## Karnaugh Maps (K-maps)
- K-map for Bool function in these 2 vars consists of 4 cells, where a 1 is placed in cell representing minterm if this minterm is present in the expansion
- Cells are said to be adjacent if minterms that they represent differ in exactly one literal

|     | y   | y'   |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| x   | xy  | xy'  |
| x'  | x'y | x'y' |

### Ex 1:
- find K-maps for xy +x'y

|     | y   | y'   |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| x   | xy  | xy'  |     |
| x'  | x'y | x'y' |     |

Step 1:
- mark all present minterms associated with each cell

|     | y     | y'  |     |
| --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| x   | **1** | 0   |     |
| x'  | **1** | 0   |     |

### Combining Cells
- Whenever there are 1s in 2 adjacent cells in K-map, the minterms represented by these cells can be combined into a product involving just one of the variables
### Rules of Combining Cells
- Circle rows / columns of adjacent 1's
- Circle amount via powers of 2 (starting from 2^1)
	- 2, 4, 8, 16
- Circle adjacent squares of 1's (given they are of correct amount)

## K-map in 3 Variables
- rectangle divided into 8 cells
- 

|     | yz   | yz'   | y'z'   | y'z   |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| x   | xyz  | xyz'  | xy'z'  | xy'z  |
| x'  | x'yz | x'yz' | x'y'z' | x'y'z |
### Ex's: Use K-maps to minimize SOPs
1) 
![[K-map 3 vars ex.png]]



2) xyz' + xy'z' + x'yz + x'y'z'

|     | yz  | yz' | y'z' | y'z |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| x   |     |     |      |     |
| x'  |     |     |      |     |


3) xy'z + xy'z' + x'yz + x'y'z + x'y'z

|     | yz  | yz' | y'z' | y'z |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| x   |     |     |      |     |
| x'  |     |     |      |     |

4) 3 input circuit, if the # ones is > # zeros,
		yes -> 1
		otherwise -> 0


| x     | y     | z     | T/F?  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| **0** | **1** | **1** | **1** |
| 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| **1** | **0** | **1** | **1** |
| **1**     | **1**     | **0**     | **1**     |
| **1**     | **1**     | **1**     | **1**     |
F(x,y,z) =

	xy'z +
	xyz' +
