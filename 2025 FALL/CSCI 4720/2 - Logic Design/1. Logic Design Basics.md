## Decimal Number
- base 10
- digit 0-9
- Base: no. of digits a numb system is using

## Binary Number System
- base 2
- uses 0-1

## Decimal to Binary
- Divide decimal by 2 repeatedly
- Keep remainder
- Keep dividing until quotient == 0
- Collect remainders bot-to-top

35 1
17 1
8 0
4 0
2 0
1 1
## Binary to Decimal
- Place Value of Digits in Decimal Number 
- Multiply each digit w/ its place value

## Hexadecimal Numbers (Hex)
- made to make binary data easier to read
	- instead of long 32 bit strings, instead use hex
- Base 16
- Uses 10 decimal numbers and English Alphabets
	A, B, C, D, E, F

## Hex to Binary
- Convert to Decimal:
- 1 way:
	- (12AC)_16
		- (1 x 16^3) + (2 x 16 ^2) + (10 x 16^1) + (12 x 16^0)
		- too complicated
- 2:
	- 2^4 = 16 --->
	- Represent each number as 4 bit binary
	- (12AC)_16
		- (0001)(0010)(1010)(1100)

## Binary to Hex
- group in 4 bit strings from right-to-left
	- 1010 0110 1100 0101 1100
	- ( A 6 C 5 C )\_16
## Digital Electronics
- The electronics inside modern computer are *digital*
- Digital electronics operate w/ only 2 voltage levels of interest: a high voltage and a low voltage
	- Low (L) and High (H)
	- False (F) and True (T)
	- 0 and 1

## 2 Logic Block Types
- **Logic blocks are categorized as 1 of 2 types**, *depending on whether they contain memory*
- **Blocks w/o memory are called combinational**; *the output of a combinational block depends only on current input*
- **In blocks w/ memory**, *the outputs can depend on both inputs and the value stored in memory, which is called sequential logic*

## Boolean Algebra
- Comprised of:
	- Boolean constants: 0 and 1
	- Boolean variables which can take values 0 and 2
	- Boolean operators
		- Not: (Complement or inverse): X'
		- Or: (inclusive or): X + Y
		- And: X * Y or XY
		- Exor: (exclusive or)
		- Nand: (not and)
		- Nor: (not or)
- Boolean Functions: Expressions involving Boolean variables, constants and operators
	- F (X,Y,Z) = X * Y \` + X * Z\` `

## Combinational Logic Truth Tables Ex:
- An n-variable Boolean function can be represented by a truth table with 2^n rows
- Example F(X,Y,Z) = XY + YZ
	![[Combinational Logic Truth Tables Ex.png]]
- AND takes precedence over OR
- NOT over AND

| X   | Y   | Z   | XY  | YZ  | T/F |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
- (xy + YZ) + (XY + yz) + (XY + YZ)

KNOW:
- how to write truth table logic FOR
	- drawing combinational logic that implements this truth table


| X   | Y   | Z   | 'X  | 'Y  | 'Z  | XYZ' | XY'Z | X'Y'Z' | T/F |

| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    | 0    | 0      | 0   |
