1. 3 Processors w/ same instruction set

- Execution time or CPU time = (Instructions * CPI) / clock_rate
- always convert to Hz

p1 - 3 GHZ rate, CPI 1.5
p2 - 2.5 GHz rate, CPI 

2.00e+9 insturctions

CPU execution time:
1. (2 x 10^9) x 1.5 / (3 x 10^9) = 1
2. (2 x 10^9) x 1.5 / (2.5 x 10^9) = .8
3. (2 x 10^9) x 1.5 / (4.0 x 10^9) = 1.1

- Execution time or CPU time = Instructions * CPI / clock_rate

10 seconds CPU time constant - find IC
IC = CPUtime (10s) * rate /  CPI

1. IC = 10s * (3 x 10^9 Hz) = 2e10
2. IC = 10 s * (2.50 x 10^9 Hz) = 2.5e10
3. IC = 10 s * (4.00 x 10^9 Hz) = 1.82e10

new time = 10s x .2 (20 % decrease) = 8s
1  new cpi = 1.5 x 1.1 = 1.65
	  new rate = Instructions * new cpi / new time
	  new rate = 2e10 x (1.65) /  8 = 4.125 x 10^9 Hz = 4.1 GHz

Consider three different processors P1, P2, and P3 executing the same instruction set. P1 has a 3.00 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.5. P2 has a 2.50 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. P3 has a 4.00 GHz clock rate and has a CPI of 2.2.

a. Find execution time for each processor {The first three answer boxes in order of processor number, only write the rounded (up) time in seconds in format of d.d; e.g. 0.7} for a program with 2.00e+9 (2e+09 is a notation for 2x(10^9) = 2,000,000,000) instructions. Which one is the fastest {The fourth answer box just the number of fastest processor, 1, 2, or 3}?

b. If the processors each execute a program in 10 seconds, find the number of instructions that they are running {The answer boxes 5, 6, and 7 for processor 1 , 2, and 3 respectively, in the format of d.dde+dd; e.g. 1.79e+10}? We are trying to reduce the execution time by 20% but this leads to an increase of 10% in the CPI. What clock rate in GHz should we have to get for this time reduction for each processor {The last three answer boxes in order of processor numbers in format of d.d; e.g. 3.1}?

"The Pentium 4 Prescott processor, released in 2004, had a clock rate of 3.60 GHz and voltage of 1.25 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 90 W of power.  
The Core i5 Ivy Bridge, released in 2012, had a clock rate of 3.40 GHz and voltage of 0.90 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 40 W of power.

For each processor find the capacitive loads {The first answer box is for Pentium 4 and second answer box is for Core i5; values should be rounded in the format of d.dde-dd; e.g. 2.46e-09 - - do NOT write the unit ahead of your answer}."

do the following:  
"Assume that for a program, compiler A results in a dynamic instruction count of 1.00e+9 and has an execution time of 1.1 s, while compiler B results in a dynamic instruction count of 1.20e+9 and an execution time of 1.5 s.

2. find C for each processor based on each GHz and V and avg P
P = C * V^2 * f
C = P / (V^2 * f)
- convert GHz to Hz, in order to yield Farads (F) units for C.

1 -
P = 90W
V = 1.25 V
f = 3.6 GHz = 3.6 x 10^9 Hz

C = 90 / (1.25^2) x (3.6 x 10^9) =
1.60e-08

- P = 40 W
- V = 0.90 V
- f = 3.40 GHz = 3.40 x 10^9 Hz

`C = 40 W / ( (0.90 V)^2 * (3.40 x 10^9 Hz) )`  
`C = 40 / ( 0.81 * 3.40 x 10^9 )`  
`C = 40 / ( 2.754 x 10^9 )`  
`C = 1.45e-08`

3. IC = 2.389e+12, CPUtime = 750s, reference time = 9650

find CPI is clock cycle time - .333ns

**CPI = (Execution Time (T) * Clock Rate (f)) / Instruction Count (IC)**
- Instruction Count (IC) = 2.389e+12
- Execution Time (T) = 750 s
- Clock Cycle Time = 0.333 ns = 0.333 x 10^-9 s
- Rate = 1 / freq  = 3.003003... x 10^9 Hz
must be in seconds, b/c freq yields cycle per second

1. **Calculate CPI:**  
    `CPI = (750 s * 3.003003... x 10^9 Hz) / (2.389 x 10^12 instructions)`  
    `CPI = (2.25225225 x 10^12) / (2.389 x 10^12)`  
    `CPI = 0.9427...`

find SPEC ratio
SPEC Ratio = Reference Time / Execution Time

**Given:**

- Execution Time = 750 s
- Reference Time = 9650 s

**Calculations:**  
`SPEC Ratio = 9650 s / 750 s`  
`SPEC Ratio = 12.8666...`

**Answer:**  
SPEC Ratio = 12.87
