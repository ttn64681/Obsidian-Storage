### What is Comp Arch?
- **The science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components**
- **Designing hardware/software interface to create computing system that meets**:
	- Functional
	- Performance
	- Energy consumption
	- Cost and other specific goals

- *Compiler compiles human-readable code to machine binary code via assembler*
- *CPU executes instructions from that executable machine code*

### What do we mean by computer?
- Different types: desktops, servers, embedded devices
- Different uses: automobiles, graphics, finance
- Different manufacturers: Intel, Apple, IBM, Microsoft
- Different underlying techs and different costs!

### What is a Computer?
- Components:
	- Input
	- Output
	- Processor
	- Memory ( disk drives, DRMA, SRAM, CD)
	- Network
- Our primary focus: **the processor** (data path and control)

### How do Computers Work?
- Need to understand **abstractions** such as:
	- App software
	- Systems software
	- Assembly lang
	- Machine lang
	- Architectural Issues: Caches, Virtual Memory, and Pipelining
	- Sequential logic and finite state machines
	- Combinational logic and arithmetic circuits
	- Boolean logic, 1s and 0s
### **Levels of Abstraction: Computer Systems Stack**
1. App
2. Algorithms + Data Structure
3. Programming Lang
4. Compiler
5. Operating Systems
6. Instruction Set Arch -> ( HARDWARE )
7. mIcroarchitecture -> ( HARDWARE )
8. Combinational and Sequential Logic (to implement Hardware) -> ( HARDWARE )
9. Binary (0s and 1s) -> ( HARDWARE )

### Processor Components:
**Inside:**
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Register
- Cache
**Outside:**
- MEM
- I/O

- We need inside components in order to access and communicate with outside components
- *ALU:*
	- X + y is *fetched by ALU from memory*
	- Faster (speed of memory is slower than the speed of the processor)
- *Register:*
	- Small, high-speed storage locations directly that *hold data that ALU is currently processing* or will in immediate future
- *Cache:*
	- Used to *store stuff from slower main Memory that processor might need to access again soon*, thereby speeding up access times
	- Can only store several kb or mb in register
	- Because high-speed memory is expensive, cache size is kept relatively small

### Memory Stack:
*Fastest, yet smallest storage*
1. Register (Reg)
2. Cache
3. MEM
4. Disk
5. Memory Management Unit (MMU)
*Slowest, yet largest storage*

- **_This is just one cpu in one chip_**
- **_Modern day computers have Multicore processors_**
- **_We only focus on single core processor_**

### Cache :
- Ex: Initialize 2d array to 0s -> Which is faster?
1. for int I
	for int j
		a\[i]\[j] = 0

2. for int I
	for int j
		a\[j]\[i] = 0

- How is it stored in memory?
	- Rule/column based caching
		- Cache Line
			- Cache Unit
#### *What does this mean?* 
- Because via rule-based caching reads the 2d array line by line top to bottom, it reads 00, 01, 02, 03, … as 00010203. 
- Therefore, approach 1, since it goes through each column (reads entire row first) and doesn’t jump to the next row, is faster
- Approach 2, since it jumps to the next row, makes the cache not be able to read it until the entire row/ line is filled, therefore it is slower

### Major Components of Computer
- I/O
- CPU
- MEMORY
- System Bus - comm pathway for data transfer b/w components

### What is CPU?
- a type of chip
- *Central Processing Unit (or uP)*
- *Control Unit & Instruction Decoder*
- Synchronize and control overall operation of uP system
- To decode instruction and pass necessary control signals to CU (control unit)
- **Contains:**
	- Arithmetic/Logic Unit
	- Registers
	- A set of internal storage locations w/in CPU

### 2 Kinds of Registers
- Control and Status Registers
	- Ex: Program Counter (PC)
- User-Visible Registers
	- Ex: General-Purpose registers
### Speed of CPU Based on 
- It’s clock
- Format of instruction
- Parallel nature of instruction execution
- Access time to its memory & I/O

### Memory
- 2 Different Types of info stored in memory:
	- Instruction ( stored by PC program counter )
	- Data
- Ex: adding 2 numbers
	- Instruction: Addition operation
	- Data: the actual numbers

**_What type of memory does program counter register use?_**
- **_Program address is an instruction pointer, so program counter register uses instruction type memory_**

### I/O
- Input Devices
- Output Devices

### Buses:
- Computer Buses: Think of them as roads that connect diff parts of a computer
- System Buses: Buses within a single computer
- **3 specialized types of buses:**
	- **Address bus**
		- *Carry CPU-generated address (of byte of data) out to memory & I/O devices* (to store or find)
		- *This generated addr tells memory controller or I/O device **where** to find or store data/instructions*
			- Ex: address of an instruction
			- address of data
			- address of an I/O device register
		- (Each byte has an address)
		- Sends address from cpu to memory (unidirectional)
	- **Data bus**
		- *Data signals that travel out of and into CPU (bi-directional)*
		- Number of wires in data bus depends on word size that the CPU operates with
			- 32 bit CPU has database consisting of 32 wires
			- 64 bit CPU has database consisting of 64 wires
	- **Control bus**
		- Consists of wires, some of which carry signals from CPU to external devices, while others carry signals from external devices to CPU
		- *They signal whether the data from data bus is a READ, WRITE, Interrupt, etc.*
		- Number of wires present varies from one CPU to another
		- Ex of control bus signals are **READ** and **WRITE**

### Cache :
- Faster but smaller mem on CPU
- If data is in cache *(cache hit)*, access is very fast
- If data not in cache *(cache miss)*, main memory will be accessed (very time-consuming)
- We can have **multi-level** cache -
	0.  Reg 
	1. L1 Cache (SRAM)
	2. L2 Cache (SRAM)
	3. L3 Cache (SRAM)
	4. Memory (DRAM)
- Main memory is much larger than cache

##### Set associativity:
- refers to a cache organization mechanism where each memory block can be placed in multiple locations within the cache, allowing for more flexible and efficient data retrieval.

#### **_Questions/Quizzes:_**
What type of memory does program counter register use?
- Program address is an instruction pointer, so program counter register uses instruction type memory
