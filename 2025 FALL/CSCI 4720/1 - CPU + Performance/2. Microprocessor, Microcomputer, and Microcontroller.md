**uP:** *CPU unit* packaged in single chip (chapter 1)
**Microcomputer:** computer that uses uP as its CPU, *e.g., personal computer (PC)*
**uC:** created by packaging CPU, MEM, and I/O parts and buses in single chip, e.g., Intel 8051m ARM Cortex-M *(INCLUDES the CPU unit)*

## Hardware 
- refers to physical equipment used for input, processing, output, and storage activities

## Some Primary Storage
- **Registers:** part of CPU w/ least capacity, storing extremely limited amounts of data only immediately before and after processing
- **RAM:** part of primary storage that holds software program and small amount of data when brought from secondary storage
- **Cache memory:** type of primary storage when computer can temporarily blocks of data used more often

- *All Volatile* - data lost when power is off
- Cache and Register needs to be inside microcontroller (CPU)
- RAM is cheapest and biggest

Register - 
- x86 - 32 bit
- holds and processes data in chunks of 4 bytes at a time

| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

## Secondary Storage
- Memory capacity that can store very large amounts of data for extended periods of time
	- nonvolatile
	- takes much more time to retrieve data
	- cheaper than primary storage
	- can take place on a variety of media
	- e.g. disk, tape

### Memory Stack:
*Fastest, yet smallest storage*
**Primary -** 
1. Register (Reg)
2. Cache
3. MEM (RAM)
**New -**
4. *Persistent*
	- *NEW TECHNOLOGY* to <u>bridge gap between speed of RAM and Storage of Disk</u>
	- little bit faster than Disk, little bit slower than RAM
**Secondary -** 
5. Disk
6. Memory Management Unit (MMU)
*Slowest, yet largest storage*

#### Computers are Used in Diff Classes of Applications
- Desktop Computers: designed for use by individual
- Servers: used for running larger programs for multiple users
- Supercomputer: high-end scientific and engineering calculations
	- highest capability but represent small fraction of overall computer market
- Embedded Computers: hidden as components of systems. A computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application

## 8 Great Ideas in Comp Arch
1. Design for **Moore's Law**
	- *Number of transistors on microchips doubles every 2 yrs*
	- More transistors = More heat
	- End of Moore's Law: 
		- Need new ways to increase single-core (1 CPU) performance or increase CPU performance
2. Use **abstraction** to simplify design
3. Make **common case fast**
4. Performance via **parallelism**
5. Performance via **pipelining**
6. Performance via **prediction**
7. **Hierarchy** of memories
8. **Dependability** via redundancy

## Layers of Software
- **System software:** software that provides services that are commonly useful
	- *Operating Systems*
	- *Compilers*
- Operating system *interfaces b/w a user's program and the hardware* and provides *supervisory functions* such as:
	- Handling basic I/O
	- Allocating storage and memory

Application Software > System Software > Hardware

## Assembly and High-Level Lang
- **Assembler:** program that *translates a <u>symbolic version of instructions</u> into binary version*
- **Assembly lang:** A symbolic representation of machine instructions
- High-level lang: lang such as C or Java

## Compilers & Assemblers
```
// C program
int x = 10
x = 2 * x + 15

vvv COMPILER vvv

# MIPS assembly language
addi r5, r0, 10		# r5 = r0 + 10
muli r5, r5, 2		# r5 = r5 * 2
addi r5, r5, 15 	# r5 = r15 + 15

vvv ASSEMBLER vvv

(MIPS machine lang)
op = addi
        r0	r5			   10
0010000000001010000000000001010
0000000000001010010100001000000
0010000101001010000000000001111
		                   15
```
- encoded in 32bit binary
- x corresponds to r5
- first line in first 2 corresponds to initialization (r0 = 0)
- can only do single operation per line (addi, muli)
- source operand 
	- provides data that is used as input for operation (addi)
- vs destination operand
	- location where result of operation is stored (r5)

- **C vs Assembly file access:**
	- C - file I/O library, abstracting underlying system calls
	- Assembly - direct interaction w/ os' system calls or directly manipulating hardware registers 


## Instruction Set
![[REPO/2025 FALL/CSCI 4720/1 - CPU + Performance/Pasted Images/Instruction Set.png]]

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Set of instructions that computer processor can understand and execute
- Very important abstraction:
	- **Interface (contract) b/w hardware and software**
	- **Advantage**: different implementations of same arch
		- *hardware standardization*
		- *seamless software portability*
		- compatibility across devices
		- *backwards compatibility* - ability of newer CPU to run software designed for an older version of same ISA w/o requiring mods
	- **Disadvantage**: sometimes prevents using new innovations
		- can't modify ISA or it will break it
	- Modern instruction set architectures:
		- x86, ARM, RISC-V, Power, MIPS, SPARC, and others

## Hardware and Software Revolution
- Hardware
	- Personal Mobile Devices (PMDs) instead of PC
	- Cloud Computing
- Software
	- Software as a  Service (SaaS)

## PMD (Personal Mobile Device)
- small wireless devices to connect to the Internet
- rely on batteries for power
- software is apps
- e.g. smartphones, tablets

## Cloud Computing
- Instead of traditional servers
- Relies on giant data centers that are now known as  *Warehouse Scale Computers (WSCs)*
	- Amazon and Google build these WSCs
- Let companies rent portions of them so that they can provide software services to users w/o having to build WSCs of their own

## Delivery Modes of Cloud Computing
- SaaS
- PaaS
- IaaS

### SaaS
- deployed via cloud
- delivers software and data as service over Internet, usually via thin program such as browser
- e.g. web search and social networking

### PaaS
- programming langs and OS are provided by vendor
- System devs use PaaS

### IaaS
- Resources Including data storage and servers are provided by vendor
- System admins are using IaaS
