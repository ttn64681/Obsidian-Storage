**Exam Material** 

**Make sure to review the following topics:**

**Strikethrough** **topics are NOT required for this test.**

- **Software Engineering General Topics**

- Software life cycle and SE development activities
- Being able to answer general questions about software engineering.

- **Software Process Types and Software Process Models.**

- Be able to differentiate between (RUP, Waterfall, prototyping, and Scrum)

- **Requirements Specification and Modeling**

- Differentiate between functional, non-functional requirements, and constraints (pseudo requirements).
- Define and differentiate non-functional requirements.
- Differentiate between scenarios, use cases, and user stories.
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Scenarios and their types
- Use case diagram (generalization, includes and extends relationships)
- Be able to create and understand domain class diagrams (purpose, notation: classes, associations (roles, multiplicities, directionality, aggregations, generalizations, association classes)
- Be able to create and understand object diagrams.
- System sequence diagram (purpose, notation, participants, different types of messages)

- **Requirements Analysis and Dynamic UML Modeling**

- Purpose of UML interaction diagrams (sequence and communication diagrams, and their notation)

- UML Sequence Diagram notation (lifelines, activations, messages, combined fragments)
- UML Communication Diagram Notation
- Understand the purpose of activity diagrams
- Entity vs. boundary vs. control classes; UML stereotypes
- **Be able to create a sequence diagram given a use case description and a first-cut design class diagram**
- Be able to add a view layer, data access layer and  to sequence and communication diagrams.
- Be able to convert a sequence diagram to a communication diagram and vice versa.

- **System Design**

- Design Activities
- Subsystem decomposition
- Design principles (Coupling, cohesion, separation of concerns, Indirection, object responsibility)
- What is meant by the open-close design principle?
- Common architectural styles (client/server, layered, repository, MVC, and pipe and filter). 
- Realizing design goals.
- Component and deployment diagrams (purpose and notation only)
- Be able to draw a simple deployment diagram given a system description and design goal(s).

- **Object Relational Mapping**

- Mapping classes and their attributes
- Mapping associations - multiplicity considerations
- Mapping association classes.

- **Design Patterns**

- The SOLID principles.
- What are design patterns?
- Classification of design patterns (Creational, structural and behavioral) for the included patterns: -
- Singleton pattern (Structure, applicability, and examples)
- Abstract Factory pattern (applicability, when to use)
- Factory method ((Structure, applicability, and examples)
- Decorator Pattern (Structure, applicability, and examples)
- Adapter Pattern (Structure, applicability, and examples)
- Proxy Pattern (Structure, applicability, and examples)

                     Be able to select the appropriate pattern given a problem.

Be able to explain how a design pattern supports the SOLID principle(s).

Be able to apply an appropriate design pattern to solve a specific software problem by developing a design class diagram that clearly depicts the solution structure and relationships among classes. 

- **Testing**

- Verification vs. validation
- Different types of tests
- Be able to distinguish between black-box testing and white-box testing and their testing techniques.
- Non-functional testing (Stress testing), definition, and how to apply.
