- Is the process of understanding and defining the services required by a system
- ensures the final software meets user expectations and attains high quality

## Scenario

**Scenario:** *a specific example of a use case*
- only covers a single instance of a scenario;
- it does not enumerate every possible way a use case can be played out

## From Scenario to Use Cases
To craft a *use case*:
1.  identify all scenario types that cover every possible situation of scenario
2. extract candidate use case names
3. For each use case, detail:
	1. participating actors
	2. entry condition
		- system state before use case
	3. flow of events (basic and alternative)
		- basic flow: 
		- alternative flow: still expected in success case
	4. exit condition
		- desired system state after use case
	5. exceptions
		- situations that cause failure or deviation
	6. non-functional requirements
	7. Special requirements
		- Timing, reliability, security constraints

## Actors
- Primary actor:
	- initiates use case
- Secondary actor:
	- provides assistance

## Examples
**Exceptions**
- connection loss b/w one actor and central system
**Special Requirements**
- Acknowledgement must be delivered w/in 30 secs
- Dispatcher's response must arrive no later than 30 secs

## Interaction Flow Notation
- Actor step -> System response
	- alternates throughout description
- Reference domain objects (e.g., Account.balance) when needed.
- Reference UI controls (e.g., Submit button) for clarity

## Exception Handling
- Card insertion: Invalid card
	- *System Reaction:* return card, stop interaction
- PIN entry: Invalid PIN
	- *System Reaction:* announce failure
- Amount entry: Amount over limit
	- *System Reaction:* Notify limit, allow retry or cancel


## Relationships b/w/ Use Cases
**includes** - Reuse of Common Functionality
- Problem: Duplicate behavior across multiple use cases
- Solution: Extract common flow into separate Use case and **include*** it where needed

**extends** - Optional/Exceptional Extensions
- Problem: Rare or conditional behavior that should not clutter main flow
- Solution: Model extra behavior as extending UC

**generalization** - Inheritance of Behavior
- Problem: Several use cases share similar but not identical steps
- Solution: Create a parent UC (e.g., ValidateUser) and derive specialized children (CheckPasscode, CheckFingerprint).
