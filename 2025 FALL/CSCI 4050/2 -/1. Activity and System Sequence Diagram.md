System Sequence Diagram:
- good for sequencing
- how API is decomposed into set of interfaces and how classes are interacting
- abstracts system internal code

# System Sequence Diagram
- A UML sequence diagram
- Special case for a sequence diagram
	- Only shows actor and one object
	- The one object represents the complete system
	- Shows input and output messaging requirements for a use case
- Actor, :System, object lifeline
- Messages

## Creating SSD
- Convert from Use Case Description (Actor and System)

## SSD Message Examples
- **Opt Frame** (optional, or an if condition)
	- [accessory selected]
	- ------------> addAccessory(anAccessory)
	- **accessory details**

- **Alt Frame** (if-else)
	- [taxable item]
	- \-----
	- [else]

EXAMPLE:
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 09.58.24.excalidraw]]

In Use Case Description
- convert actors and systems into input method and output method
- "Customer indicates desire to create customer account and enters basic customer info:"
- Customer                                                                            -----> :System
	- createNewCustomer(name, phones, emails)
	- cust ID, name, phones, emails
	- *address details := enterAddress (address)

# Object Diagrams
## Business Rules:
- A customer must store at least one payment card.
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.02.40.excalidraw]]
- A customer may store none or at most 4 payment cards.

## Association Relationships
- 2 classes may be connected by multiple associations as long as all of them have diff meanings
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.06.52.excalidraw]]

![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.09.27.excalidraw]]

## Reverse Engineering
- Draw a class diagram that represents the relationship b/w the classes.
```
sdfdsf 
```

- A class can have an association to itself, called a self association (or a recursive asosciaton)
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.18.36.excalidraw]]

son can have many or no children

## Ex: Draw a domain class diagram
- Person has exactly 2 parents
- A person can have many or no children
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.21.06.excalidraw]]


## Self/reflexive/recursive Association
- A person can have 2 parents
- A person can also have 


## Association Relationship
- **note that self associations are binary**

```
// Parent could be an array of size 2
public class Person {
	private Person[] parent;
	private Children[] children;
}
```


## Draw a domain diagram
-  a student can register for one or more courses. A course can have at least 15 students
- We need to store the student's grade in each course
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.30.32.excalidraw]]


# Aggregation vs Composition
## Whole-Part Relationship
- we can model objects that contain other objects by way of special associations called aggregation and composition
![[Drawing 2025-09-23 10.41.04.excalidraw]]
## Aggregation
- represents "has-a" relationship where parts can exist independently of whole
- if whole is destroyed, parts can still exist
- Lifecycle: Parts have an independent lifecycle from whole
- Ex:
	- **Car has an engine**
	- **if car is scrapped, engine can be removed and used separately**
	- *Hollow diamond* on the whole side of association line

## Composition
- represents a strong "owns-a" relationship where parts are essential to whole and cannot exist independently
- **If whole is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed**
- Compositions are denoted by a *filled-diamond* adornment on the association

```
class CommitteeMeeting {
	private Person[] members;
	private Person[] attendees;
	String eventDate;
	String location;
	
	public CommitteeMeeting(Person[] m, Person[] attendess)
	{
		// Constructor did not create the members and attendees objects.
		if (m == null)
			// throw an exception;
	}
}

class Person {
	private String name;
	private String phonel
	public Person()
	{
		// person constructor code
	}
}
```

### Recognize Aggregation or Composition?
- If Committee constructor creates the Person arrays:
	- That means Committee does NOT own Person

## Drawing a Class Diagram
- A folder may have have many subfolders or files
![[Drawing 2025-09-25 10.15.30.excalidraw]]
- is-a relationship implies inheritance / generalization
	- For example, a `Dog` "is a" `Animal`.

## Enumerations


# Interface

## Interface Surfaces


## Interface Realization


## Abstract Class
- cannot be instantiated
- written in italics


## Entity Objects
- *Stereotype: \<<Entity\>>*
## Control Object
- *Stereotype: \<<Control\>>*
## Boundary Objects
- *Stereotype: \<<Boundary\>>*

## Naming Object Types in UML
- UML provides the stereotype mechanism to introduce new types of modeling elements
