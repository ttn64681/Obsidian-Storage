System Sequence Diagram:
- good for sequencing
- how API is decomposed into set of interfaces and how classes are interacting
- abstracts system internal code

## System Sequence Diagram
- A UML sequence diagram
- Special case for a sequence diagram
	- Only shows actor and one object
	- The one object represents the complete system
	- Shows input and output messaging requirements for a use case
- Actor, :System, object lifeline
- Messages

## Creating SSD
- Convert from Use Case Description (Actor and System)

## SSD Message Examples
- **Opt Frame** (optional, or an if condition)
	- [accessory selected]
	- ------------> addAccessory(anAccessory)
	- **accessory details**

- **Alt Frame** (if-else)
	- [taxable item]
	- \-----
	- [else]




In Use Case Description,
- convert actors and systems into input method and output method
- "Customer indicates desire to create customer account and enters basic customer info:"
- Customer                                                                            -----> :System
	- createNewCustomer(name, phones, emails)
	- cust ID, name, phones, emails
	- *address details := enterAddress (address)
