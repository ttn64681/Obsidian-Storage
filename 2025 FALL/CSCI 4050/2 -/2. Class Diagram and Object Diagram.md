# Class Diagram
- static structure representing:
	- **possible classes** (object types), including their attributes and operations, and
	- **relationships** among them
		- extends (superclass, )
		- implements (interace)

# Object Diagram
- is a structure including
	- **objects** (including their attribute values), and
	- **links** (connections) among them

## Classes
- class is a description of a set of similar objects that share the same set of attributes, oeprations, relationships, and meaning
- Graphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle, usually including its name, attributes, and operations in separate, designated compartments

### General format:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |


## Domain Class Diagram
- only includes classes from problem domain
- incomplete
	- don't know attributes
	- don't know operations
- e.g., Booking: Movie, Customer, Ticket (1...\*), Seat (1...\*), Show Room, ...

| ClassName  |     |
| ---------- | --- |
| attributes |     |
| operations |     |

| Person     |     |
| ---------- | --- |
| name:      |     |
| address    |     |
| birthdate  |     |
| /age       |     |
| ssn        |     |
| move()     |     |
| function() |     |
- don't know specifically about params
## Design Class Diagram
- adds classes from the solution domain
- complete
	- know attributes
	- know operations


| Person           |     |
| ---------------- | --- |
| name: String     |     |
| address: Address |     |
| birthdate: Date  |     |
| ssn: Id          |     |
| move()           |     |
| function()       |     |

### Attribute visibility can be:
- +
- -
- \#
- ~
- /

# Class diagrams vs Object diagrams
- Object: 2 parts
- identifier: ClassName
- attribute 1 = value 1

| [identifier] | ClassName |
| ------------ | --------- |
| attribute1 = | value1    |
| attribute2 = | value 2   |
