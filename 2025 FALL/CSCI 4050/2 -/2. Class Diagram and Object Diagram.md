# Class Diagram
- static structure representing:
	- **possible classes** (object types), including their attributes and operations, and
	- **relationships** among them
		- extends (superclass, )
		- implements (interace)

# Object Diagram
- is a structure including
	- **objects** (including their attribute values), and
	- **links** (connections) among them

## Classes
- class is a description of a set of similar objects that share the same set of attributes, oeprations, relationships, and meaning
- Graphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle, usually including its name, attributes, and operations in separate, designated compartments

### General format:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |


## Domain Class Diagram
- only includes classes from problem domain
- incomplete
	- don't know attributes
	- don't know operations
- e.g., Booking: Movie, Customer, Ticket (1...\*), Seat (1...\*), Show Room, ...

| ClassName  |     |
| ---------- | --- |
| attributes |     |
| operations |     |

3 parts:

| Person     |     |
| ---------- | --- |
| name:      |     |
| address    |     |
| birthdate  |     |
| /age       |     |
| ssn        |     |
| move()     |     |
| function() |     |
- don't know specifically about params
## Design Class Diagram
- adds classes from the solution domain
- complete
	- know attributes
	- know operations


| Person           |     |
| ---------------- | --- |
| name: String     |     |
| address: Address |     |
| birthdate: Date  |     |
| ssn: Id          |     |
| move()           |     |
| function()       |     |

### Attribute visibility can be:
- +
- -
- \#
- ~
- /

# Class diagrams vs Object diagrams
- Object: 2 parts
- identifier: ClassName
- attribute 1 = value 1

| [identifier] | ClassName |
| ------------ | --------- |
| attribute1 = | value1    |
| attribute2 = | value 2   |



| p11: Person        |     |
| ------------------ | --- |
| name = "Joe Smith" |     |


# Relationships
- In UML, object interconnections are modeled as relationships
- These are 3 kinds of relationships in UML:
	- **dependencies** ---->
	- **associations** (solid line) ->
	- **generalizations** - |> (open arrow head, hollow)

Customer Object
   | 
PaymentCard Object

Association: whole_part relationship 
- Composition
- Aggregation

## Dependency Relationship
- A dependency indicates a semantic relationship b/w 3 or more elements

| Semester Schdule  |     |
| ----------------- | --- |
|                   |     |
| add(c: Course)    |     |
| remove(c: Course) |     |
   |
  v

| Course |     |
| ------ | --- |
|        |     |


## Generalization Relationship
Subclass Generalizes to SuperClass
- a generalization connects a subclass to its superclass
- a subclass inherits all attributes an doperations from its superclass

- class may have multiple parents (super classes)

WorkStudy extends Student and Worker


## Association Relationships
### Solid line
- this means class-type variable
### Directionality
- 2 classes are related in some way, or need to communicate w/ each other

- the name of an association represents its meaning
- it should be a verb phrase
Student hasTeacher -> Teacher
Student <- teaches Teacher

- *put extra directionality arrow head next to student or teacher*

### Multiplicity
**1..***
Student - has Teacher - Teacher
					*1..**
- **means Student can have 1 or more Teachers**

### Ex
Router reliesOn -> DomainNameServer
```
class Router {
	DomainNameServer dns;
	public Router() { // construction
		
	}
}
```
```
class DomainNameServer {
	/**
	/*
	/* No Router Object Defined
	/*
	/**
	
	public DomainNameServer() {
	}

}
```


### Role Name
- We can also indicate how a class participates in an association by specifying its role in association
- *solid line*
- **A role name is a name of an association's endpoint**
- If role names are specified, the association name is usually not needed, but still may be given

	Rolename:   Rolename:
	*student*      *teacher*
[Student]-              -[Teacher]
		**1..\***           **1..***

```
class Student {
	Teacher[] instructor;
	public Student() {
	// ensure that instructor list is Not empty
	// otherwise, throw an exception

	}
}
```
```
class Teacher {
	Student[] student;
	...
}
```
- bidirectional

## Association Multiplicities
- Multiplicity may take general form of
	- M .. N, where M and N may be non-negative integers
		- (Mâ‰¤N) or \*, to indicate any non-negative number
		- M .. M is usually written as just *
		- 0 ..* is usually written as just *
		- 1 .. 1 is just 1, or not provided at all (default)
[A]-       -[B]    one-to-one
- 
[A]-      0..1 -[B]    optional
- 1 A object (default) must have 0 or 1 B object
- B object cannot have 0 A object
[A]-       \*-[B]    one-to-many
[A]-*       \*-[B]    many-to-many


# Quiz questions
**Which of the following Object Diagrams are consistent w/ the class diagram?**
[A]-1    1 -[B]

a) [:A] the colon means OBJECT DIAGRAM
- cannot just have an A with no B in the system
b) [:B]
- cannot just have a B obj w/o A object
c) [:A]----[:B]
	|\_\_\_\_[:B]
- no, question shows a 1-to-1 relationship
d) [:A]-   -[:B]
