# Outline
```table-of-contents
```
**Aspects:**
- Architectural Design

Importance:
- Integrity Control

**Analysis: From requirements Models to Design Models**
- Requirements models point to Analysis model
- Analysis models point to Design model
- Design models 

- **Agile SKIPS the analysis model to produce a product FASTER**

# Architectural Design
## Typical models for Defining Application Components
View Layer
- Search Item Window
- AddItemWindow

Domain Layer
- CatHandler
- OnlineCart
- CartItem
- PromoOffering

Data access Layer
- CustomerDA
- OnlineCartDA
- CartItemDA

### 2 approaches
1. Have view layer access data access layer directly
	1. faster but less secure
2. Have View layer talk to domain and domain talk to data, separation of responsibility
	1. slower but more secure

Previously, we worked with Domain model (entities) (Deliverable #4 )
Now, we'll work with Design Modeling
- Design phase is all about NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
	- throughput
	- security
- Detailed design
	- object design patterns

Promotions:
- check end date is greater than start date of promotion

# Exams:
- **know key design questions for each Activity (slide)**
	- Designing Security and Integrity Controls is involved for all of these
- *The other slides are NOT for the exam, but stuff you should still consider*
