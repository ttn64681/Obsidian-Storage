## Design principles
- Coupling and Coherence of Subsystems

## Coupling and Coherence of Subsystems
- Goal: Reduce system complexity while allowing change
- **Coherence** measures dependency among classes
	- *High coherence:* The classes in subsystem perform similar tasks and are related to each other via associations
	- *Low coherence:* Lots of miscellaneous and auxiliary classes, no associations
- **Coupling** measures dependency among subsystems
	- *High coupling:* Changes to one subsystem will have high impact on the other subsystem
	- *Low coupling:* A change in one subsystem does not affect any other subsystem

- **High coherence = Low coupling**



# SOLID Principles
- S - Single Responsibility principle
- O - 
- L
- I - Indirection principle
## S - Single Responsibility
- SEPARATION OF LAYERS
	- ViewLayer should NOT interact w/ Database

## I - Indirection principle
- Place component b/w multiple components to decouple them
	- Ex: 3 components connect directly to database
		- if you change database, you'd have to update all 3 components
		- instead, create a storage interface that connects to database
			- components implement storage interface
		- if you change database, you only have to update 1 component
