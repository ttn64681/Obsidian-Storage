## Term Project Cinema E-Booking System

### Problem Statement:

The online Booking system has *one theatre and few number of employees and halls*. The system keeps information about thousands of *movies*, *show times*, and *registered customers*. 

The system is a web-based application that provides internet users to ==view information about the movies== and to ==book their tickets and seats online==.  Users will be able to ==pay their tickets online==, ==upon payment users can save or print their tickets==.  

The system will also *keep information about its registered users*. Hence, the system should *provide a registration facility to its users.*  

The system should **enable the system administrators to *add and update*** *movie information*, *ticket prices and types*, *user information*. System administrator will **view real time statistics of** *booking*, *sales*, *running movies*, and *registers users*.

*Ticket prices are set according to the age category of the ticket owner*. The system has three age categories: ***Child, adult and senior.***

### Development Process:

<u>We will develop the software according to a set of predefined requirements.</u> Our process model is an <u>incremental hybrid model</u> that combines both the waterfall and agile methodologies. We will apply Waterfall for the overall project planning; setting phases and pre-planned deliverables, on the other hand, we will take advantage of the flexibility of Agile by injecting Agile practices within our planned phases to produce an early working version of the system. We will schedule coding as set of sprints; Thus, requirements will be refined before each sprint of the incremental process. Will also benefit from Agile by incorporating testing in the development; to ensure that a quality product will be produced. 

Teams can work “Agile” while making sure the processes adhere to the plans created in the initial phase. Development phases that can be handled simultaneously; shouldn’t have to wait for each other. For example, two team members might be working on UI design while other members can start building database tables.   

 ==Prototypes will be used for to help designing the UI to gain feedbacks and more customer involvement== which will reduce the risk of project failure and/or customer dissatisfaction.

Once the system is completely implemented, it will be tested according to the developed software components by applying _adequate_ subsystem testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.

Deadlines for all project deliverables are announced on the course assignment page on eLC. Team leaders should submit deliverables to the corresponding assignment folder on eLC. 

Final project demonstration will be around Tuesday, 11/30/2022.

  

### High-Level System Requirements:
