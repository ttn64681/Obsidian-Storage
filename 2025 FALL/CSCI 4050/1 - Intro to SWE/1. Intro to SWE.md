#### Goal of SWE:
- **Produce quality software on time and w/in budget**
### The Software Crisis
- "software crisis" coined by some attendees at first NATO Software Eng Conference Germany 1968
- Revolves around 3 concepts:
	  Complexity
	  Change
	  Expectations
- 1990s:
	- 31% projects canceled
	- 52.6% cost avg 189% over budget
	- 84% late or over budget (91% for large companies)
	- avg system delivered w/o 58% of proposed functionalities
	- $81 bil in 1995 for canceled projects
	- $51 bil in 1995 for over-budget projects
	- Only 16.2% software projects are completed on-time and on-budget

### Importance of SWE
- specific software needed in almost every industry, in every business, and for every function
- More important as time goes on - if something breaks w/in app portfolio, a quick, efficient, and effective fix needs to happen ASAP

### SWE is more than writing Code:
- Facets of SWE:
	- Problem Solving
		- creating a solution
		- engineering a system based on the solution
	- Modeling
	- Knowledge Acquisition
	- Rationale Management

### What Is SWE?
- *engineering discipline* that is concerned w/ *all aspects of software prod* from early stages of system specification thru to maintaining the sys after it has gone into use
- *a collection of techniques, methodologies, and tools that help with the production of a high-quality software system developed **within a given budget**, **meeting a given deadline**, **while change occurs.***
- **Engineering discipline:** Using appropriate theories and methods to solve probs bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints
- **All aspects of software prod:** Not just technical process of development. Also proj management and development of tools, methods, etc. to support software prod

## Attributes of "Quality" Software
1. **Maintainability**
2. **Dependability and Security**
3. **Efficiency**
4. **Acceptability**
## SDLC
1. Requirements Eng
2. Software Design & Coding
3. Software Testing
4. Software Eval /Evolution

### Requirements Eng:
- User Stories:
	- Describes the why and what behind
	- Ex:
		- "As Max, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together."
		- "As Sascha, I want to organize my work, so I can feel more in control."
		- "As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures."
- Use Case Doc

### Software Design:
- **Software Architecture:**
	- consider model options, ex:
		- *MVC (Model View Controller)*
			- Model : Persistent Data
			- Controller : Business Logic, Operations
				- Model: tells model to change / update
				- View: also tells view to change
			- View : Presentable Screen UI
- Detailed Design:
	- **SOLID Principle**
	- Consider security and 3rd party or external APIs
	- Consider: what if you have software using YouTube API? What if you want to change?
		- Use *adapter class* which applies to YouTube API Logic
		- Allows for open/close principle (SOLID Principle)
		- Allows for reusable classes
		- Applying changes only applies to Youtube API Logic Adapter Class
	- **Design Patterns**
		- *Singleton* - ensures class has only 1 instance and provide global point of access to it
		- *Adapter* - allows classes w/ incompatible interfaces to work together
	- **UML**
## Agile Model
- *(delivering 1 piece of cake at a time)*
- **Scrum Team:**
	- Team adapts and plans internally
	- **Sprints:**
		- Sprint 1: delivers a deliverable of view, business logic, data analysis, database logic,
		- Sprint 2: delivers next part of deliverables…
		- Sprint 3: etc.
- Incremental and Iterative
- Flexible and Collaborative

## Software Products
- **Generic products**
	- *Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them*
	- Examples - PC software such as graphics programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as appointments systems for dentists
- **Customized products**
	- *Software that is commissioned by specific customer to meet their own needs*
	- Examples - embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems

## Product Specification
- Generic products
	- **Specification** of what the software should do is **owned by the software developer** and decisions on software change are made by the developer
- Customized products
	- **Specification** of what the software should do is **owned by the customer for the software** and they make decisions on software changes that are required

## Final Group Project
- [ ] Class on Next Monday btw

- Deliverables
	- Due dates are actually the demo dates
	- low-stake, multiple
	- don't worry about getting C
		1. User Stories Doc
		2. Use Case Doc
- Activity Modules Reviews are similar to Corresponding Quizzes
- Activities Practice is important for Quizzes!!
	- 5-10 mins
