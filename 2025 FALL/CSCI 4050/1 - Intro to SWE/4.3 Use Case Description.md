## Describing Interaction Flows
- **Alternative paths** should *start with a conditional branch* from the basic path.
	- An alternative path may merge back into the basic path or terminate the use case on its own.
- Similarly, **exceptional paths branch conditionally from the basic path** and may terminate the use case or merge back into the basic path.
### Ex:
1. If in step 4 the Loan.requestedAmount is greater
than $300,000, the system invokes the
NotifyLoanManager use case.
2. ..

## Guidelines for Writing Use Cases
- Flow of events:
	- use active voice (The Actor..)
	- All flow of events should be described (not just main)
	- boundaries of system should be made clear
		- components external to system should be described

## Ex: Badly written use case
"**The driver arrives at the parking gate, the driver receives a ticket from the distributor, the gate is opened, the driver drives through.**"
Problems:
- It is not clear which action triggers the ticket being issued.
- Because of the passive form, it is not clear who opens the gate
	- (The driver? The distributor? An attendant?)
- It is not a complete transaction. A complete transaction would also describe the driver paying for parking and driving out of the parking lot.
