Hitchhikers are team members who piggy-back off the success of other team members, without much consequence. Hitchhikers have the uncanny ability of detecting how much work they can get away with; As a result, they're often accusatory, blame-deflecting, and criticizing, despite being in the wrong. 

When dealing with hitchhikers, it is important not to absorb all of their problems and instead, confront them directly and show you have a bottom line. If they continue to hitchhike, then act consistently and discuss their behavior with the professor  (e.g., show proof of their lack of work) where they can be punished or fired.
