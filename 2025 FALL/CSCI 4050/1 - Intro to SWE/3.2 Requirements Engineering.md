## The Working Parts
- **Backlog:**
	- an ordered, ever-evolving document of list of items needed to build a product/service
	- Ex:
		- technical tasks
		- user stories
		- bug fixes
		- new features
	- Goal: Provide shared understanding of what's next, facilitate planning and prioritization, and ensure team is working on most valuable and important items of product


### Categories:
- Epic
- User Stories
- Features
## Software Requirements Specifications
- **outlines the purpose, behavior, and functionality of a software application**
- **Often includes a "Use Case Doc"**

- Clear and structured description of the software's
	- purpose,
	- scope,
	- functional requirements,
	- non-functional requirements (like performance and quality attributes),
	- external interfaces,
	- constraints, and
	- acceptance criteria

- Includes:
	- high-level Epics:
		- describe large bodies of work ->
	- specific Features:
		- detail functionality ->
	- detailed User Stories:
		- from an end-user perspective
- Each level incorporates Acceptance Criteria to define successful Completion:

- **User Stories:**
	- Describes the why and what behind
	- Ex:
		- **"As** Max, **I want** to invite my friends, **so** we can enjoy this service together."
		- "As Sascha, I want to organize my work, so I can feel more in control."
		- "As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures."
- **Use Case Doc:**
	- **Actors:** The users or other systems that interact with the system being designed. 
	- **Goals:** The objectives that the actor is trying to achieve by interacting with the system. 
	- **Interactions:** The sequence of steps, inputs, and outputs that occur between the actor and the system to accomplish the goal. 
	- **Flows:** The various ways a use case can unfold, including a primary (or "basic") flow of events, and alternate or exceptional flows that handle variations or errors. 
	- **Pre-conditions & Post-conditions:** Conditions that must be true before the use case begins and conditions that must be true after it completes successfully or with an error.

## Requirements Flow:

**Product Backlog Refinement (Ongoing):**
- This is a continuous process where the Product Owner and the Development Team add, update, and prioritize Product Backlog items (user stories). 

**Sprint Planning (At the start of each sprint):**
- The team selects items from the Product Backlog and creates the Sprint Backlog, defining what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint. 

**During Development (Throughout the sprint):**
- **User stories** and **acceptance criteria** are refined and elaborated on (on the same product backlog item) as the team works to understand the requirements better and adapt to new insights. 

**After the Sprint (For deliverables):**
- Documentation like **user manuals** or **operational guides** is often created at the end of a sprint or as a release approaches, to support the working software
