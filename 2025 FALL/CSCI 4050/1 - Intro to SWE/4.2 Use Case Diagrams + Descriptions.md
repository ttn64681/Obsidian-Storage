## SUB DIAGRAM EX: Decomposition of Edit Profile

### Actors
- primary
- secondary
- you connect lines between actors and use cases based on:
	- accessible by [user_type]
- DO NOT connect lines thinking about order

### Includes
- to represent functional behavior common to more than 1 use case
- Reuse of existing functionality of another use case
- **Shared, mandatory behavior that is always executed as part of the base use case**
	EDIT PROFILE << INCLUDES >> Edit Personal Info
### Extends
- **to represent seldom invoked use case fragments or exceptional functionality**
- "Either / Or" inheritance relationship
- an extension is typically not a complete use case
	EDIT PROFILE <--- EXTENDS --- Edit Payment Card

- Inheritance can be done between actors

### Generalization
- "is-a" relationship
- Problem: we want to factor our common (but not identical) behavior
- Solution: The child use cases inherit the behavior and meaning of parent use case and add or override some behavior
- Example: "ValidateUser" us responsible for verifying the identity of the user. The customer might require 2 realizations:
	- "CheckPasscode" and "CheckFingerprint"

### Generalization b/w actors
- Generalization of an actor means that one actor can inherit the role of the other actor
- The descendant inherits all the use cases of the ancestor
- The descendant has one or more use cases that are specific to that role

## Separation of Concerns: 
MyID authentication doesn't  INVOKE Duo verification

## Modeling Use Case Diagram after Use Case Description

| Use case         | Checkout                                                                                                       | System                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flow of events   | Customer:<br>1. User shows desire to checkout<br>2. User confirms address<br>3. User enters payment info       | 1.1 System displays the stored shipping address and asks the user to confirm the address<br>3. System displays stored card and asks user to confirm card |
| Exception        | 1.1 At step 1.1 if the system did not find a stored address, the system **invokes the use case Enter Address** |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Alternative flow | At step 2 the user may choose to use another address, the system **invokes the use case Enter Address**        |                                                                                                                                                          |
