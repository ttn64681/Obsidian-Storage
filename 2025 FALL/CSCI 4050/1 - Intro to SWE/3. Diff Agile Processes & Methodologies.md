## Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- an implementation of iterative development (includes elements of Waterfall Model but organized into an iterative, incremental process)
- in Iterative Development, a process framework:
- Involves: Detailing the Requirements
- Emphasizes: *creating a robust architecture early in the process, before extensive coding begins,* to ensure the final product is well-structured

- Notice: This is still heavily plan-driven/waterfall!!! Still phases
	- But it is also incremental

Which activity peaks in the Construction Phase? Elaboration?
1. Construction -
2. Elaboration - Analysis and Design
Which phase is testing mainly done in?
- Construction
## Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
