## Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- in Iterative Development, a process framework:
- Involves: Detailing the Requirements
- Emphasizes: *creating a robust architecture early in the process, before extensive coding begins,* to ensure the final product is well-structured

**RUP Ex:**

|                   | Inception | Elaboration | Construction         | Transition |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
|                   | I1        | E1 \| E2    | C1 \| C2 \| C3 \| C4 | T1 \| T2   |
| Business Modeling |           |             |                      |            |
| Requirements      |           |             |                      |            |
| Analysis & Design |           |             |                      |            |
| Implementation    |           |             |                      |            |
| Test              |           |             |                      |            |
| Deployment        |           |             |                      |            |
- Notice: This is still heavily plan-driven/waterfall!!! Still phases
	- But it is also incremental

Which activity peaks in the Construction Phase? Elaboration?
1. Construction -
2. Elaboration - Analysis and Design

## Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
