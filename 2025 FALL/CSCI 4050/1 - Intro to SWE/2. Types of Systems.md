- **Stand-alone systems**
	- *Run on local computers, such as PC; include all necessary functionality; do not need to be connected to network*
- **Interactive transaction-based systems**
	- run on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own local systems; *processes individual user transactions in real-time, providing immediate feedback and updating data instantly*
		- these include Web applications, e.g. E-Commerce applications
- **Embedded control systems**
	- Software systems embedded in hardware, that control and manage hardware devices;
		- *likely more embedded systems* than any other system types
			- e.g., a washing machine control system that manages water level, temp, and cycles
- **Batch processing systems**
	- *business systems that are designed to process data in large quantities (batches)*; process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs
		- e.g., a payroll system that generates employee salaries at end of each month
- **Entertainment systems**
	- systems that are primarily for *personal use*, which are intended to entertain the user
- **Systems for modeling and simulation**
	- *systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations*
		- car crash simulation
- **Data collection systems**
	- systems that *collect data from their env* using set of sensors and *send that data to other systems for processing*
		- **often incorporate w/ batch processing systems**
- **Web-Based Systems**
	- platform for running apps
	- Web Services (WS) *allow application functionality to be accessed over the Web*
	- **Cloud computing** is an approach to the provision of *computer services where applications run remotely on "cloud"*
		- Users do not buy software but pay according to use

## Parties in System Development
- Parties involved in system development:
	- **Users** (direct/indirect)
	- **Customer/procurer**
	- **Producer/developer**
- All 3 are usually different
- **What are stakeholders?**
	- *any people with an interest in the system's development or its outcomes*
		- includes developers and managers, along w/ customers, suppliers, and even regulatory bodies

### Users play a central role
- Systems should be:
	- specified based on user needs
	- validated whether it really functions according to user needs
	- documented by describing system from user's pov

## Software Development Process
- Methodology of developing software systems is frequently referred to **Software Development Process** or simply Software Process
- **Structured set of activities required to develop a software system**

- Many diff software processes exist, but all involve:
	- **Specification** (Requirements Engineering)
		- defining what system does ``
	- **Design and implementation**
		- defining organization and implementation of system
	- **Validation**
		- checking that it does what customer wants
	- **Evolution**
		- changing system in response to changing customer needs

## Types of Software Processes
- **Plan-driven processes**
	- all process activities *planned in advanced* and progress measure against plan
- **Agile processes**
	- planning is *incremental* and *iterative*, and is easier to change process to reflect changing customer requirements

- most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches
- there are no right or wrong software processes

## Software Process Models
- **Waterfall model**
	- *mostly used for large systems engineering projects where system is developed at several sites*
- **Incremental development**
	- adding new functionality in small chunks
	- You can apply waterfall or scrum
	- example, waterfall, but ship after each phase
	- *Advantages:*
		- cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced
		- is easier to get customer feedback on development work that has been done
		- more rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible
		- early increments act as prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments
		- lower risk of overall project failure
		- highest priority system services tend to receive more
	- *Disadvantages*:
		- Process not visible
		- too much documentation
		- system structure tends to degrade as new increments are added
- **Iterative development**
- **Agile development**
- **Reuse-oriented development**
- **Prototyping**
	- 
- **Spiral Model**
- **Formal Transformation**

### Waterfall Model
- **Requirements definition**
	- SRS - software requirements specifications - functional requirements; users should be able to do xyz
	- nonfunctional requirements; users should be able to email within 2 seconds, should have encrypted passwords
- **System and Software design**
	- Design Document - system + software design + architecture design + api
	- We need classes/interfaces here and 
- **Implementation and unit testing**
	- testing separate modules
		- Unit - 1 module
		- Integration - multiple modules
		- Systems - end2end
		- Acceptance - tested by users
- **Integration and system testing**
	- making sure all modules work with each other and whole system is working as expected
- **Operation and maintenance**

#### When to use Plan Driven vs Agile?
- **Plan driven** when:
	- you *can't deploy iteratively*, like a car
	- requirements well-understood, changes fairly limited
	- Safety critical systems, like embedded systems, where you have clear, long specifications
- **Agile:**
	- you *don't need hard-set specifications*

## Coping w/ Change
- Change is inevitable in all large software projects:
	- business changes lead to new and changed sys requirements
- Change leads to reword so costs of change include both rework and costs of implementing new functionality
- to cope w/ change, we don't do SEQUENTIAL
- instead, we want INCREMENTAL

## How to Reduce Costs of Rework
- **Anticipate Change** ( Change Avoidance )
	- create *prototype system* (mockup of how product will be implemented)
		- ex: mockup of UI
	- Prevents scope creep
- **Change tolerance**
	- *Some form of incremental development.* Process is designed so changes can be accommodated at relatively low cost
