# 1. Client-Server
- Client initiates communication, Server responds
- Client knows about Server, Server knows nothing about Client

- Checking email
	- PC is client
	- Server is outside email manager for distributing emails
- Searching movie
	- Application is client - you search w/in db
	- Server is DB server to provide movie tuples
### Problems w/ Client/Server
- do not provide p2p communication
- p2p communication is often needed
- Ex:
	- Database must process queries from an app and should be able to send notifs to the app when data has changed
- If you want Admin 

# 2. Peer-to-Peer
### Relationship Client/Server & P2P
- Problem statement "Clients can be servers and servers can be clients"
- Which model is correct?
- Model 1: "a peer can be either a client or a server"
- Model 2: "a peer can be both a client and a server"
	- inheritance : "either-or"

# 3.0 3-Tier Layer
- **3-Tier Architecture** usually refers to 3 hardwares - Client Tier, Business Tier, and Database Tier
- **3-Layer Style** in general divides a system into three logical, distinct tiers:  
    1. **Client Tier (User Interface):** Interacts with the user (e.g., web browser, mobile app).  
    2. **Business Tier (Application Server):** Contains application logic and processes data (e.g., web/app server).  
    3. **Data Tier (Database Server):** Stores and retrieves data (e.g., database).
- Ex: Website Design


# 3.1 Closed Multi-layer
### Closed Architecture (Opaque Layering) principle
- Each VM can only call operations from the layer below

- **Design Goals:**  
	- **Maintainability:** Clear boundaries, reduced coupling.  
	- **Flexibility:** Easier to update/replace layers independently.  
	- **Security:** Critical components are isolated in lower, protected layers.

-  closer architecture -> higher maintainability/flexibility/security

# 4 . Repository Architecture Style
![[Drawing 2025-10-20 10.52.15.excalidraw]]
- **Goal:**
	- <span style="background:#fff88f">Design good overall system response time</span>
	- Example:
		- IDE
			- lexical analysis
			- fast error
- **Cons:**
	- *Maintainability:*
		- High coupling b/w components
		  		- if you change repository, you have to change each component
	- *Performance on high load.*
# 5. Pipe & Filter
![[Drawing 2025-10-20 10.54.11.excalidraw]]
- **Goal:**
	- <span style="background:#fff88f">Design good overall system throughput</span>
	- Example:
		- IDE
			- type mismatch
			- 100 errors at syntax analyzer
- **Cons:**


## How to get best of both worlds?
- Get both **response time** and **maintainability**?
	- **MVC!**

# 6. MVC
- Model-View-Control
![[Drawing 2025-10-20 11.00.27.excalidraw]]

# Design Principles
- Highly Cohesive:
	- components are not tightly coupled


Design goal of old compilers is throughput, and drawback is response time
