# OOD
- First cut DCD (Design Class Diagram)
- Extend use case w/ Communication Diagram or Sequence Diagram
- Final DCD
- package diagram

- CRC Cards are tool for identifying classes, responsibilities, and collaborations (NOT DIAGRAMS)
- Communication and Sequence Diagrams are Interaction Diagrams
- KEY DIFFERENCES:
	- Communication Diagrams have links
	- Sequence Diagrams have life-lines

# OOD w/ Sequence Diagrams
# OOD w/ Communication Diagrams
- Communication Diagrams can have sequences of messages defined by NUMBERING
- ![[Drawing 2025-11-06 10.10.44.excalidraw]]
- **Whole numbers** (1, 2, 3, 4)  represent top-level sequence of messages.
	- Message 2 happens after 1, 3 after 2, etc.
	- Indicate next main step
- **Decimal numbers** (1, 1.1, 1.2) indicates nested messages
	- 1 is initial message, 1.1 is message sent as result of message 1 (or while message 1 is still in progress)
	- 1.2 also happens during 1 or as result of 1, after 1.1
	- Describes internal messages

- How do we know if 2 objects communicate directly, choose Communication Diagram
- If we want detailed input output messages and loop frames, sequence diagrams are good
- hard to tell if 2 objects are communicating directly in sequence diagram

## Convert Sequence to Communication Diagram
- harder

## Convert Communication Diagram to Sequence
- easier

# Exam Tips/Questions

may give use case description and ask which diagram is correct? (given communication diagram options as answers)

may ask more about solid principles applied to a diagram or not?
- is there coupling between classes

won't be given problem to do from scratch

**Ex Problem:**
- be given use case description
- be given design class diagram with navigation arrows
- then draw sequence diagram

prepare all steps, then draw one thing only


**communication diagram to sequence diagram**
- comm diagram doesn't have timeline, but has links between objects if they communicate
- need the link if 2 objs sending messages to each other
