- Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step
- Allows you to produce diff types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Context:
- how can a class ?
- how..?

An object will not be constructed in the Constructor, it will be constructed in the Builder class, which sends it to the constructor


- Builder class will have same attributes as the Car builder 

```
Main:
Car car = new Car.CarBuilder().id(101).brand().model().color().build()
```

```
public class Car {
    // Car's attributes (id, brand, model, color)
    private final int id;
    private final String brand;
    private final String model;
    private final String color;

    // Private constructor - only accessible by the Builder
    private Car(CarBuilder builder) {
        this.id = builder.id;
        this.brand = builder.brand;
        this.model = builder.model;
        this.color = builder.color;
    }

    // Public getters for Car's attributes (optional)
    // ...

    // --- Static Nested Builder Class ---
    public static class CarBuilder {
        // Builder's attributes (same as Car's, but mutable)
        private int id;
        private String brand;
        private String model;
        private String color;

        public CarBuilder id(int id) {
            this.id = id;
            return this; // For chaining
        }

        public CarBuilder brand(String brand) {
            this.brand = brand;
            return this;
        }

        public CarBuilder model(String model) {
            this.model = model;
            return this;
        }

        public CarBuilder color(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        // The build method creates the Car object
        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this); // Calls Car's private constructor
        }
    }
}

```

## Director
- The Director is an optional part of the Builder pattern.
- It **orchestrates the construction process.** 
	- It knows the order in which to call the builder's steps to produce specific types or configurations of the product.
- It works with the Builder interface, so it doesn't need to know the concrete type of builder or product. 
	- *This allows the same Director to construct different representations using different concrete builders.*
- **The client can either directly use a Builder to construct the product step-by-step, or it can delegate the construction to a Director.**
