# The Other Half: Immigration and Urbanization in the Industrial Era
Very closely related to industrialization (work from europeans seeking refuge, and asians).

In the relatively recent past, to be American is to be an immigrant.
# The "Great American Melting Pot"?
# Four Immigration "Waves"
**The first two waves were comprised mainly of *North Western European immigrants.***
## The "Third Wave" -c. 1880-1920
More than 29 million individuals came into the US.
# Why immigrate to America? and where?
1. America has pull factors/attractions
	- **coming for economic opportunities**
	- **freedom of religion**
2. There are push factors in the immigrant's place of origin
	- **Antisemitism** in Russia and Poland pushed Jews out of Europe; <font color="#ffff00">Jews looking for a safe place</font>
		- Pagram (Violent anti Jewish riots)


- **lots of young men come over to perform laborious jobs,** 

Come in through Ellis Island.
- interviewed but with low rejection rate

**Immigrants don't come to the South because there aren't a lot of factories brimming with job opportunities.** *There are mines and sharecropping but its already occupied by poor whites and blacks*. Instead they head to ...
<font color="#ffff00">- Detroit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">- Chicago</font>
<font color="#ffff00">- New York</font>

**75% of population in Chicago and some areas were immigrants.** 
# City Life
## Cultural Support
As soon as immigrants land in the city, they'll most likely look for people of their culture.
- **ethnic enclaves such as China Town, Little Italy, etc. in New York**
## Employment
Immigrants set up support networks. 
## The "Political machines"
**A political machine is a metaphor** 
- corrupt **"political machines"** (like Tammany Hall) that provided services in exchange for votes.
- people tend to join political parties because they believe what the party stands for
- a political machine is associated with political parties
<span style="background:#ff4d4f">- a political machine runs the politics of a city to make money; does not matter what party</span>
<font color="#ffff00">- cities are run by political machines</font>
<span style="background:#fff88f">- yet provide essential welfare</span>

I**mmensely corrupt but did provide services for the immigrant population coming in.**
- political machines would turn on its constituents in a heart beat to favor profits 
### New York City's "Tammany Hall"
New York's power structure that runs the city (political machine).
- example
	- Suppose you'd like to open a bar and not have the police force bother you
	- get a permit and bribe the police force that is owned by "Tammany Hall" 
	- whatever is needed is provided by other members and leaders
	- a network of favors
	- all that is required is that you vote for me (them, the leaders of the political machine) always
		- otherwise, face repercussions 
<span style="background:#ff4d4f">- immensely corrupt</span>
# Living Conditions
## The bad: crowding, poverty, dirt and disease
So many people pouring into cities
- 100,000 people per square mile in NYC
- people live in tenements
	- *cheap, crappy apartment building run by slumlord*
	- avg. 4 rooms with 18 residents
		- share a bed with someone
	- also served as workplace
		- rolling cigars
		- components of shirts made

People could rent a place to sleep for the night
- e.g., dirty mattress on barrels

Saloons, lots of drinking
- primary photo of saloon
	- women drinking but with shawl covering her because she doesn't want to be seen,  shes socializing with african american

**200 tons of horse manure on streets of NYC everyday.** 

People were noticing these conditions and painted/captured this.
- the cliffdeller by George bellows
	- new york tenement scene


## The good: close community, attractions of city life
# Fears of immigrants among native-born Americans
Feeling of revulsion, the core of backlash.
<font color="#ffff00">- nativism - rejection of immigrants for any number of reasons</font>
## their Catholicism/Orthodox/Judaism
America is a majority protestant christian country, but many are catholic, orthodox or even Jewish. 
- this triggers <font color="#ffff00">religious animosity from the native, largely protestant population</font>

Some people mocked anti catholic fears

**Anti Jew**
- believed they brought disease, poverty, anarchy

## their threat to natives' jobs
Feared job competition.
- worried that immigrants would lower wages  and be a threat to american workers
### Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
<font color="#ffff00">Chinese immigration in the West.</font>
- American nativists also felt animosity towards Chinese
	- believed they would ruin white labor/threat to native jobs, bring disease, were sexually deviant 

First ever act to exclude a particular group of party. 
- **no chinese people could come legally after 1882**
- by 1924, all asian immigration would be banned 
## their "radicalism" and Marxist/socialist policies
Feared that immigrants were bringing in dangerous political ideologies that were harmful to American ideals. 
# Immigrants and Urban Reform
Not every American are nativists. 
## Jacob Riis and How the Other Half Lives
Jacob Riis was an immigrant from Denmark.
- took photos to document immigrant life
- argued that immigrants are good people and have potential but are held back by their living conditions
	- "they are what the tenements have made them"
- How the Other Half Lives is a book of photos designed to trigger outrage such that government action is done to improve safety regulations, sanitation, etc
- big fan of turning immigrants into Americans (sounds familiar to Native American assimilation )

	The influx of immigrants sparked **nativist fears** among native-born Americans, driven by religious animosity (Protestant vs. Catholic/Orthodox/Jewish), perceived threats to jobs (leading to lower wages), and concerns about "radical" political ideologies. These fears culminated in restrictive legislation like the **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882**. However, some individuals, like **Jacob Riis**, used photography in works like _How the Other Half Lives_ to document immigrant struggles and advocate for urban reform, arguing that improved living conditions would allow immigrants to thrive.

## Urban Reformers
The men and women who criticized the political bosses and machines — and the corruption and vice they fostered — ***usually came from the ranks of the upper middle class and the wealthy***. Their solutions to the urban crisis typically centered around toppling the political machine and replacing it with a civil service that would allow government to function on the basis of merit rather than influence peddling and cronyism. 

<font color="#ffff00">- merit based system</font>

Opposition to machine control was largely led by middle and upper-class reformers, "Good Government" leagues, muckraking journalists, and progressive politicians. They offered solutions such as:
    *   **Civil service reform:** Appointments based on merit rather than political loyalty.
	    * <span style="background:#fff88f">Congress responded to this demand by passing the **Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act,** </span>
    *   **Direct democracy:** Initiatives, referendums, and recalls to empower citizens directly.
    *   **Professionalization of city management:** Hiring non-partisan city managers or establishing city commissions.
    *   **Non-partisan elections:** To reduce the influence of party machines.
    *   **Social work and settlement houses:** To provide services to the poor and immigrants, challenging the machine's monopoly on aid.
