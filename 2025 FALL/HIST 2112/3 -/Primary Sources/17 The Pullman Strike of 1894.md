Explain the reasons industrial workers sought to organize against their employers and evaluate why they were not more successful in gaining a larger share of economic and political power in the late nineteenth century.

Late-nineteenth-century industrialists exercised massive power over workers and the conditions of labor. Workers organized into ==unions== to **secure higher wages, shorter hours, improved safety, and a fairer measure of control of the labor process**. Even those corporate owners who were considered sympathetic to the needs of laborers and their families, such as railcar magnate George Pullman, assumed the right to manage their businesses as they saw fit (Source 17.6). Though Pullman had constructed a model town with clean housing and parks for his employees, he refused to heed workers’ economic complaints after the depression of 1893 began (Source 17.8).

Yet this power did not go unchallenged. **When the American Railway Union (ARU), headed by Eugene V. Debs** (Source 17.7), <span style="background:#fff88f">launched a nationwide strike against the Pullman company</span> in May 1894 to improve economic conditions and gain recognition for the union, Pullman refused to negotiate. Rebuffed by Pullman, the union coordinated strike activities across the country from its headquarters in Chicago. Workers refused to operate trains with Pullman cars attached, and when the **railroads hired strikebreakers,** some 260,000 strikers brought rail traffic to a halt. In response, U.S. attorney general Richard Olney, a member of many railroad boards, **obtained a federal injunction ordering strikers back to work**, but without success. At Olney’s recommendation, <span style="background:#ff4d4f">President Grover Cleveland ordered federal troops into Chicago to enforce the injunction.</span> Their clash with strikers resulted in *thirteen deaths, more than fifty injuries, hundreds of thousands of dollars in property damages, and the spread of violence to twenty-six states* (Source 17.9). After the government arrested union leaders, including Debs, for disobeying the injunction, the strike collapsed in July 1894, and the Supreme Court upheld Debs’s imprisonment.
