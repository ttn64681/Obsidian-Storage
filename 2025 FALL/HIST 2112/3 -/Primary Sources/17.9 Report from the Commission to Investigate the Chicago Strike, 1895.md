The commission appointed by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the Pullman strike concluded that strikes were wasteful, disruptive, and unlawful. Blaming both capital and labor for the strike, the commission believed that the Pullman trouble originated because neither the public nor the government had taken adequate measures to control monopolies and corporations and had failed “to reasonably protect the rights of labor and redress its wrongs.”

- **concluded that strikes are wasteful and unlawful, attributing the conflict to both capital and labor**
- It specifically blamed the lack of government and public control over monopolies and corporations, as well as the <span style="background:#fff88f">failure to protect labor rights.</span>
- - **Made recommendations that largely favored labor,** such as making anti-union contracts illegal, <span style="background:#fff88f">urging employers to recognize and negotiate with unions</span>, and establishing permanent arbitration bodies.


- **George Pullman (Source 17.6):** Believed he treated his workers fairly by <span style="background:#40a9ff">***providing a model town with good housing and amenities.***</span> He felt his business decisions, including wage cuts during a depression and refusal to arbitrate, were within his rights as an owner to manage his company as he saw fit.
- **Jennie Curtis (Source 17.8):** Contradicted Pullman, testifying that workers were treated unfairly. She detailed drastic wage cuts that left them destitute and the humiliating demand to pay her deceased father's back rent from her meager earnings, demonstrating severe exploitation.

1. **How does being a woman affect Jennie Curtis’s experiences as a Pullman worker (Source 17.8)?**
    - being a woman for Jennie Curtis likely meant facing these harsh economic realities with ***fewer resources (lower wages, vulnerable to wage cuts and exploitation)***, greater social vulnerability, and an amplified burden of responsibility.

2. **According to Eugene V. Debs (Source 17.7), what is the purpose of labor activism? How does the Pullman strike teach Debs about socialism?**
    - **Purpose of labor activism (initially):** Debs initially believed the purpose was to organize workers into unions (like the ARU) to secure higher wages, shorter hours, improved safety, and more control over the labor process within the existing system.
    - **How the Pullman strike taught Debs about socialism:** The brutal suppression of the Pullman Strike by combined corporate and government force (injunctions, troops, arrests) fundamentally changed Debs's view. This defeat, and his subsequent imprisonment, revealed the "class struggle" to him. <span style="background:#d3f8b6">He realized that mere unionism was insufficient against such power, leading him to conclude that a radical, systemic change (socialism) was necessary to achieve true economic freedom.</span>

3. **By comparison, how do you think Pullman and Debs would have responded to the report on the Pullman strike issued by the commission to investigate the Chicago strike (Source 17.9)?**
    - **George Pullman:** Would likely reject recommendations favoring labor (like recognizing unions, arbitration, or banning anti-union contracts) as an infringement on his right to manage his business. He might agree with the report's condemnation of strikes as "unlawful" but dismiss any criticism of corporate power or calls for external regulation.
    - **Eugene V. Debs:** Would likely see the report's recommendations (e.g., recognizing unions, arbitration, banning "yellow-dog" contracts) as positive, but ultimately **insufficient**. Having become a socialist, he would view these as superficial reforms that failed to address the fundamental "class struggle" and the need for a complete overthrow of the capitalist system to achieve true economic freedom.



Committee Recommendations Following Investigation of the Chicago Strike
I.

(1) That there be a permanent United States strike commission of three members, with duties and powers of investigation and recommendation as to disputes between railroads and their employees similar to those vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission as to rates, etc….
II.

(1) The commission would suggest the consideration by the States of the adoption of some system of conciliation and arbitration like that, for instance, in use in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. That system might be reenforced by additional provisions giving the board of arbitration more power to investigate all strikes, whether requested so to do or not, and the question might be considered as to giving labor organizations a standing before the law, as heretofore suggested for national trade unions.

(2) Contracts requiring men to agree not to join labor organizations or to leave them, as conditions of employment, should be made illegal, as is already done in some of our States.
III.

(1) The commission urges employers to recognize labor organizations; that such organizations be dealt with through representatives, with special reference to conciliation and arbitration when difficulties are threatened or arise. It is satisfied that employers should come in closer touch with labor and should recognize that, while the interests of labor and capital are not identical, they are reciprocal.

(2) The commission is satisfied that if employers everywhere will endeavor to act in concert with labor; that if when wages can be raised under economic conditions they be raised voluntarily, and that if when there are reductions reasons be given for the reduction, much friction can be avoided. It is also satisfied that if employers will consider employees as thoroughly essential to industrial success as capital, and thus take labor into consultation at proper times, much of the severity of strikes can be tempered and their number reduced.
