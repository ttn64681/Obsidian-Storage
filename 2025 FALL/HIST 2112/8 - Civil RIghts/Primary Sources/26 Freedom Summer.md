## Explain the aims of civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964 and evaluate the extent to which they achieved them.

**Although few black Mississippians successfully registered to vote and the MFDP was denied official recognition at the Democratic National Convention, Freedom Summer did <u>publicize the plight of black communities in Mississippi and throughout the South</u>, and <span style="background:#fff88f">this publicity contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.**</span>

This project introduces **Freedom Summer**, a 1964 campaign in Mississippi organized by a coalition of civil rights groups, including SNCC and the NAACP, under the umbrella organization **COFO (Congress of Federated Organizations).**

### Aims of Freedom Summer

The project had two clear, interconnected aims, one on the ground in Mississippi and one at the national political level:

1. **Secure Political Rights:** The primary goal was to register Black voters in Mississippi, a state where they were almost completely disenfranchised. To achieve this, activists set up **"freedom schools"** to teach voter literacy and organizing techniques.
    
2. **Draw National Attention:** By intentionally recruiting white college students, the organizers aimed to "draw national attention to the cause". They knew the violence this would provoke—like the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner—would capture the nation's focus in a way that violence against Black activists alone had not.
    
3. **Challenge the Political Establishment:** The creation of the **Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP)** was a direct challenge to the legitimacy of the state's all-white Democratic Party. The MFDP's goal was to be recognized as the official delegation at the Democratic National Convention.
    

### Evaluation of Success

The introduction presents the results of Freedom Summer as a mixture of immediate, short-term failures and profound long-term victories.

- **Short-Term Failures:** On its own terms, the project failed in 1964. "Few black Mississippians successfully registered to vote," and the MFDP was "denied official recognition" at the DNC.
    
- **Long-Term Success:** The project was a massive strategic success. It achieved its goal of "publiciz[ing] the plight of black communities in Mississippi," and this national attention "contributed to the passage of the **Voting Rights Act of 1965**".
    

### Connecting to the Big Questions

- **Who Is an American?:** This project is a central battle over this theme. It was a <span style="background:#fff88f">direct confrontation with a system that denied Black citizens their most fundamental right to vote, the very definition of being a full American.</span>
    
- **The Role of Government:** <span style="background:#fff88f">Freedom Summer exposed the failure of state and local governments to protect citizens' rights,</span> which forced the **federal government** to intervene. The project's ultimate success, the Voting Rights Act, was a massive expansion of federal power to overrule state laws and enforce the Constitution.
