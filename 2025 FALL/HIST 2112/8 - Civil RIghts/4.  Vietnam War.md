- U.S. is historically founded on Anti_Imperialism,
- but ironically we became Imperialist

# Vietnam - a short history
## French and "Indochina" Colony
### Late 1800s:
- French had colonies all over the war
	- not as big as Britain and Spain
- One of biggest colonies - Algeria and Western Africa
- Another big colony - **French-Indo China**
	- **Included VIETNAM**
	- Today it's the area of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam

### Colonize Vietnam:
- **Used army to bombard and attack and conquer Vietnam**
	- Saigon
	 - Hanoi
- Set up big towns in Vietnam
- **Wants to extract Wealth out of Vietnam**
	- RUBBER, Rice, etc.
	- Rubber Plantations
		- French kicked people off their land and made them Laborers

## Viet Minh
- **Whenever there's imperialists, there're anti-imperialists**
	- Minute-Men, etc.
	- Vietnam no different
- Vietnam successfully throws out Invaders

- French recruited Vietnamese Natives to help them run the country
- Vietnamese trained by French, but also were elites who hated French

### Ho Chi Minh (Viet Minh Leader)
- Learns about in France: French Revolution, People Rising up and overthrowing oppressors
	- Encounter Marxism, Comes back to Vietnam a Communist

- **Viet Minh are NOT controlled by the Soviet Union**
- Soviet Union do aid Viet Minh by giving weapons later, but not controlling Vietnam
- Viet Minh want an Independent Vietnam

- Viet Minh guerilla warriors fight against French
- Can't seem to quite kick them out
- Japanese soldiers come in to help and defeat the French
- Then U.S. defeats the Japanese (bombs)

**QUESTION: Who's in charge of Vietnam now???**
- Answer, nobody. There's a Power Vacuum

1946: Vietnam declares itself as new Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV)
- Ho Chi Minh modeled Vietnam's Declaration of Independence on U.S.'s Declaration of Independence
- **He reaches out to America,** not Soviets, not Communist Chinese, but to us.
- *U.S. turns him down*
	- *Reasons:* Ho Chi Minh is **Communist**

- Soviet's Angry ->
### First Indo-China War:
- - Soviets aid French in fight against Vietnam
- **US also support the French**
	- "*We'll support anyone as long as it's against Communism"*
	- *"Don't want the Iron Curtain of Soviet Union to spread..."*
	- *"Red Scare"*
- **US starts paying for French War**
- Cannot support the Viet Minh

- **Not enough:** *French are struggling*
- French are embarrassed by WWII, having been taken over by the Nazis
- 1954: French Lost
	- Dien Bien Phu
### Geneva Settlement - 1954
- Representatives from the **US**, Soviet Union, China, France, Great Britain, and Vietnam (both North and South) met in Geneva, Switzerland, to negotiate a peace agreement for Indochina.
### a) Divide Vietnam up
#### Temporary Divison at 17th Parallel:
- North:
	- Governed by the Viet Minh under Ho Chi Minh, with Hanoi as its capital.
- South:
	- overned by the State of Vietnam (later Republic of Vietnam)
- North and South we're not supposed to be Permanently North and South
- Vietnam will then have an election to see who will take over Vietnam

- **EVERYBODY KNOWS IT WOULD BE MINH TO WIN:**
- Ho Chi Minh Viet Minh are seen as the Minute Men
- long history of resistance, very patriotic
- DON'T GLAMORIZE:
	- were still corrupt
- But they'd set up healthcare systems, education systems, provide social services
- Would do "land reform" - 
- Were VERY popular

### c) U.S. Prevents Election
- Domino Theory scare...

# Entering the Quagmire
#### Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam)
- U.S. help fight against Viet Cong to basically help South Vietnam

## Support for Diem and the ARVN
- Who would lead this new Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam)?
	- **Ngo Dinh Diem**
		- Highly authoritarian
		- Buddhist Persecution
			- Famous image of Monk Burning in Protest
		- Police Brutality
		- Corruption and Nepotism
		- Wife was known as Dragon Lady
	- FDR - "He's a bastard, but at least he's OUR bastard"
- Why did U.S. support Diem? because he fought against Communism HARD!

- US - "If anyone were able to get rid of Diem from power, we'd be okay with this!"
- Several chaotic Coupes:
	- Someone did, they grabbed Diem and beat him to death in back of truck
	- We sorta introduced Chaos unintentionally
	- Cops lose power
	- Takes several coupes to finally stabilize Vietnam leadership/govt

- **Now Lyndon B Johnson is in Power**
## JFK and the "military advisors"
- Had 16,000 military advisors sent to South Vietnam to train them and help them with their battles
- Green Berets were not supposed to fight, but we know that this did actually happen
## LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution - 1964
- **very concerned about Vietnam, he HAS to do SOMETHING**
- Growing belief in Johnson Administration that American troops should go (similar to JFK Administration)
- **LBJ** knows this will not be super popular
- **Lies and tells the people:**
	- "I will not send American Boys to do a job that Asian Boys should be doing!"
	- Obviously, they had plans to...

- But we need a good reason to get involved, so what do we do?
- <span style="background:#fff88f">WE MAKE A REASON UP</span>
- Claimed that in Gulf of Tonkin that 2 US navy vessels supporting South Vietnamese guerillas were "attacked" by North Vietnamese
	- WEAK EVIDENCE
- **Is enough to give LBJ authority in Court to take action in Vietnam**
	- **"Blank Check" - Gulf of Tonkin Resolution** (go do what you gotta do)

## Direct US involvement begins - ROLLING THUNDER, Marines at Da Nang, etc.
- **MASSIVE air campaigns start immediately:**
	- Bombarding from air
- **We hit Vietnam REALLY HARD**
- *We drop 3 times amount of Ordinates of Vietnam than combined amount used against Germany and Japan*

### March of 1965
- Troops come in (3000 US Marines) to defend air base we were building 
- By 1965: there are over half a million American troops

**MASSIVE EVENT**: pulled troops out of other places to fight Vietnam War

# Notes
- if you're colonized, you're most likely colonized by capitalist country
- So you're more likely to see anti-imperialists lean towards anti-capitalist ideology i.e. Communism, Marxism
