# The Bummer Decade: The 1970s as Turning Point
# The 1970s - disillusionment, diminished expectation, and a new suspicion of government
- this era is stereotyped as the hangover after the 1960s (everyone was exhausted and just wanted to have fun)
## Decline of the Liberal Consensus
- decade of disillusionment and diminished expectation
	- people are losing trust in the government
	- postwar liberalism was built on the idea that government was a great tool for change, but this suspicion of governments means liberals are in trouble
	- conservatives are the opposites of liberals

Ronald Reagan elected despite being such an extreme conservative because of people losing faith in the government.
# The Continuing Influence of Civil Rights
- 70s saw the rise of second wave feminism
- Reform has not ended
# Vietnam and The Reaction Against "Rage"
**The Vietnam War deeply wounded people's faith in the federal government**
- Government has been sharing how the war is going well and that they will win soon
- Tet Offensive is a large scale enemy offensive that showed Americans that the reality the government sold them was false
## Political effects of the "credibility gap"
The credibility gap between what the government says and what is actually happening widens due to the Vietnam War.
### The Pentagon Papers
Daniel Elseberg(?)
- Marine w/ PHD from Harvard
- works for the Secretary of Defense
- tasked with procuring evidence that will let LBJ declare war on Vietnam
	- involved with the Tonkin evidence
	- he never comes up with much, but is initially a supporter of the war
- as the war goes on, he begins to have doubts
- visits Vietnam during the war and witnesses the credibility gap after leading troops into battle
- begins dating an antiwar reporter
- met with draft resistors 
	- witnesses their devotion to protest the war
- has a moral revelation and decides to reveal the truth
- begins secretly documenting the war
- secret history of Vietnam (7,000) pages are eventually released and publicized (these are the Pentagon papers)
## Growing disgust with radicalism
America is mad at hippies and protesters
- although some agreed the war was bad, they also believe that some have gone too far
- conservative support for police to crackdown on hippies and protesters (the radicals)
# The End of Prosperity
One of the goals of liberalism was to create affluence and build a middle class through programs such as the Great Society (economic goal)
- deep and abiding faith in economic growth
- however, the economy begins to tank (another critical hit after Vietnam War to liberalism)
## Global economic competition
After WW2, the US dominated the economy for 25 years
- most European countries were devastated after the war (destroyed factories)
- these countries eventually recovered

Japanese motors begin to enter the American market in the 1970s
- competition 

Vietnam economically was a massive waste of money
- roughly $300,000 per kill in Vietnam
- extremely expensive 
## "Guns and butter"
Economists said that LBJ couldn't choose both funding/fighting a war and growing and investing in the economy
- you can't have guns and butter, but LBJ chose both anyway
## The Oil Crisis of 1973-4
Inflation due to war
- Israel is attacked in 1973 and American is supportive of Israel
- however there are consequences
	- initially, US was energy independent
	- but by the 1970s the US have outstripped their oil supply
	- US needs to find new sources of oil such as the Middle East
	- to punish the US for their support of Israel, OPEC boycotted by artificially raising prices for oil and refusing to sell to the US
	- price of oil goes up and energy goes up
	- because everything needs energy, the price of everything goes up (up to 20%)
	- gas is not available for everyone
		- limited supply and long lines
		- national speed limit was lowered to 55mph to save gas
## Inflation and Stagflation
Not just inflation but stagflation
- inflation is rising price for things and isn't necessarily bad if your income rises at the same rate as inflation
	- as long as the prices and wages rise at roughly the same rate, it is okay 
- in stagflation, the prices go up but the wages stay the same
	- this hurts people economically
	- cries for government intervention, but as we've seen liberalism hasn't been doing the general population any favors
## The conservative response
# Watergate
Richard Nixon
- deeply insecure, angry, and vindictive man
- wins the presidency in 1968
- in 1972 Nixon wants to crush his opponents utterly (kept a list of enemies)
	- wants to get dirt on his opponents
	- hires a group of ex-CIA (the Plumbers) to break into the democratic party headquarters several times to obtain records and planted bugs (microphones) for spying purposes
		- this was at the watergate hotel
	- they are caught 
		- one of the perpetrators has a card with a number that when called, is rang to the white house president's office
		- revealed that they were hired by the president to do so
		- Nixon lawyer reveals this as well
	- during Congressional hearing that the President has a voice-activated recording device in the office
		- learns that Nixon is a racist, etc.
		- the order to Plumber should be on these tapes
		- Congress wants to hear the tapes
		- Supreme Court rules 9-0 that he has to hand over the tapes
		- Nixon resigns in 1974
		- the tapes revealed that Nixon did order the Plumbers the break-in

Nixon did irreparable damage to faith in the government
- although he was a conservative this is a massive wound to liberals because they rely on faith in government

# Race, the Southern Strategy, and Busing
## The "Southern Strategy"
Why did Deep South turn from Democrats to Republicans?
- just before the election of 1964, LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act
	- LBJ a white southern democrat saying that its time to get on the right side of history and address segregation/racism/equality
	- this infuriates racists (LBJ is deemed a race traitor)
	- Southern states protest by voting Republican
### Goldwater's southern success in 1964
Goldwater in the NAACP but voted against Civil Rights Act
- because he believed in states right
- so Southerners voted for this guy despite being in the NAACP and a Republican
- white southerner protest vote to register their anger against LBJ
### GOP Lesson - win over southern segregationist Democrats
Win over southern segregationist Democrats by advocating against Civil Rights Act of 1964
- win over anger Southern Democrats  (Southern Strategy) into Republican Party which used to primarily champion civil rights (how?)
- Nixon convinces people to vote for him by campaigning to ease government breathing behind your back (taxes etc.)
	- get the government off your back
	- for a southern democrat, getting the government off your back means getting Civil Rights Act off your back (states)
	- flips white south to Republican Party
#### Using broad "strategic language"
## Busing and northern-style segregation
# The Perfect Political Storm, and the dawn on the Reagan Era
