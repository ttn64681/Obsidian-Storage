## 2) Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
- founded Michigan, 1962
### a) Racism, poverty, and "inauthentic"
- had a chapter at UGA
- started off as nice group, middle of road
- nice ties and suits
- A lot of them had been in SNCC
	- they branched off to apply their protesting efforts to Vietnam War
- 
### b) Establishment
#### Who was responsible for all of these  lack opportunities and suffering?
- **interlocking bureaucracies**:
- **establishments made up of 3 orgs** -
1. govt
2. corporations
3. universities

- *"You choose b/w establishment candidates in elections"*
- *"you have no real choice/voice"*
- *"they want the middle-class people to shut up!"*
- universities turn you into unthinking cogs of the machine
	- conformity factories

- *"What about Johnson?"*
	- "Pfft, LBJ is a typical liberal"
- Liberals and Left are NOT the same
- At least conservatives are honest about being evil. These Libs try to make you think they're your friends! They're all part of the establishment.

#### Reason for LBJ / Liberal Hate:
- "If he really cared, he wouldn't be bombing the innocent Civilians in Vietnam"
