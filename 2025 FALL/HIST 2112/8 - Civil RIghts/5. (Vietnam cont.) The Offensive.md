...picking back up

# Fighting the War
- soldiers - you go to Vietnam for a year
	- spend time at fortified military base
	- surrounded by claymore mines
	- just gotta LAST a year

- get told that enemies detected, you go out
- get into helicopters, go near enemy location
- kill as many enemies as possible
	- call for artillery rounds from airplanes
		- Napalm bombs
			- jellied gasoline that sticks to human flesh and burns them
	- body count

- body counts are not that accurate, hard to count
- numbers inflated
	- get shown on newspaper, televised, to please Headquarters and US govt
	- "5 'o clock Follies'"
	- LBJ really wants this to go well
		- is inclined to believe the good news
		- tell the Americans what they want to hear
- 


## GOAL of Vietnam War diff than WWII
- WWI strategy: conquered enemy territory, 
	- America west, Russia east, crushed enemy
- **Vietnam strategy:**
	- not gonna work crushing
	- its a guerrilla war
	- essentially, "WAR OF ATTRITION"
		- kill people faster than they can be replaced
## 1) the ineffectiveness of air power
- bombing a lot, but not a lot of targets
	- not industrial country like Germany or japan
	- you just end up killing civilians, making them angrier

- people start getting an inkling that this isn't going all that well
## 2) the ineffectiveness of ground war
- trudging through ground, booby traps, kids and women could throw grenade at you,
- 19 yr olds we're edgy and angry
	- frustration of fighting an invisible enemy, hard to distinguish combatants from civilians
- My Lai Massacre:
	- soldiers would get angry, didn't find enemies so instead find unarmed women and children and slaughter them
	- This was revealed to public attention through journalism of Seymour Hersh

# Tet Offensive, January 1968
- Massive simultaneous uprising from Viet Cong and northern Vietnamese/Assaultation Americans throughout South Vietnam

- **U.S. military and political leaders had been portraying the war as nearing victory, emphasizing progress and declining enemy strength**
	- "We thought America was winning, them all of a sudden bunch of Viet Congs come out of nowhere!"
	- "LBJ is lying to American People, doubt..."

## credibility gap

- LBJ says OH MY GOD
	- reflected his growing doubt about the military's optimistic reports and his need for an unvarnished truth.
- **sends group of advisors at Vietnam**
- *"GET THE TRUE STORY"*

- Result: We CANNOT WIN THIS WAR.
	- we don't have enough troops
	- we HAVE TO GET OUT

## LBJ refuses to run another term
- vp doesn't win either

# Reaction
- Doubt is growing, huge protest
- People in government would have family members start protesting Vietnam
- even govt people start to doubt

## Richard Nixon
- "I'll end Vietnam War"
	- kinda bullshi7
- He pulls American troops out, and south Vietnamese troops would replace them
### Controversial Decision
- Context: viet cong takes refuge in cambodia
- Decides to:
	- Henry Kissinger invades Cambodia and bombs it heavily
	- Caused massive civilian controversy
	- **Only 1 serious Anti-Vietnam Protest at UGA**
		- it happened because of the Cambodia Invasion
	- **Ohio Kent State shootings:**
		- Live open fire on protestors
- Reaction/Hypocrisy:
	- "Nixon said he'd end the war, not expand it!"

# End of Vietnam - "We Lost", January 1973
- Peace Treaty
- South Vietnam on their own
- They last 2 years

- Last helicopter out of South Vietnam
- Americans punch Vietnamese guy off the ladder
- Embarrassing Defeat

- **North Vietnamese still in control**
- Communist economy turned out to be a disaster
	- lots of capitalist reform

## Domino Theory Hoax
- DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE DOMINO THEORY
	- Did this happen with Vietnam failure? OBVIOUSLY NOT

## American Cope
- cannot utter that "they lost"
- still say that "it was a tie"

### Rambo - Urban Myth
- Example:
	- Rambo movie
	- based on urban myth that American prisoners were still being held in Vietnam
		- Not true
			- once war ends, they're dead
	- Rambo rescues them
	- Then backstabbed by America - don't want to reveal that there were prisoners, embarrassing
	- try to kill Rambo
	- "Government Sold Us Out"
	- "It wasn't Vietnam who beat us, it was our Government!"
	- **Psychological reaction to Vietnam Loss...**
# Essence of Liberalism
- **Core Principle**: Belief that the government _should_ and _can_ actively intervene to address societal issues like poverty, civil injustice, and to execute foreign policies (e.g., containment of communism).
- **Vietnam as a "Liberal War"**: The U.S. involvement in Vietnam, driven by containment policy and a belief in government's ability to shape global outcomes, is seen as an embodiment of this liberal approach.
- **Crisis of Confidence**: The spectacular failure and loss of the Vietnam War severely eroded public faith in the effectiveness and judgment of liberal government policies.
- **Shift in Political Landscape**: This disillusionment with liberalism created fertile ground for the rise of **Conservatism**, as people sought alternative approaches to governance and foreign policy. This political shift was a direct reaction to the perceived failures of liberal interventionism.
