# Barry Goldwater

# Conservatism: from the Political Fringe to the Halls of Power
- Eisenhower , put in New Deal bill
	- not actually New Deal
- If you weren't on that side of Progressivism and Liberalism in 50's, you were kinda on the fringe

- Conservatism looked a LOT like the New Left!
- Conservatism looked a LOT like us more than you'd think...

- SDS - young, smart people
- Conservatives early on - young, smart people

- VERY DIFF IDEAS on what to do to address America's problems

- Port Huron Statement


To be a liberal, you must believ govt must be proactive:
- howver, a lot more nuance and different inner ideals and different groups within Liberals
	- Just like with Conservatives, they will fight and contradict each other on issues

- What is a Conservative? "Hell if i know, if I say I'm Conservative then I am one!"
	- hard to define because it was so complicated

- there is a checklist though generally that makes someone fit the idea of Conservative
	- Barry Goldwater checks a lot of boxes
	- Ronald Reagan checks a lot of boxes

- Conservatism: a Big Body of Ideas -
	- but at end, you'll get a picture of what Conservatism meant


### IF NOTHING ELSE, most conservatives will agree, in theory, that an active govt fixing problems, is NOT A GOOD IDEA
- what they call, "Big Govt"
- Centralized Power in Washington D.C. was bad because of 2 Reasons:

2 reasons:
1. Constitutionally, this was problematic
	1. Roosevelt making all these economic changes, *was stretching the Constitution*
	2. Exceeds its authority, doing what it's NOT allowed to do
2. Even if it was Constitutional, they screw things up!
	1. they mess things up, they don't get things done!
	2. They then trample on your rights, leaning into authoritarian/dictatorial govt
	3. 

What rights are Conservatives so worried about?:
- if we need something to be done, govt shouldn't do it... (except for local level)
	- instead, INDIVIDUALS should ddo it
	- similar to idea of private communities should deal with problems on their own
- **Private Affairs important**, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO **Economic Rights**

- Most important right is:
	- Economic Rights: Ability to buy and sell property
	- CONSERVATIVES are VERY much CAPITALIST

- therefore, weren't big New Deal fans
- Very nervous about Social Engineering:
	- effort of govt trying to fix social problems
- **Ex: Poverty**
	- govt shouldn't be trying to fix poverty! shouldn't be under their purview
	- should not be dealt with by Franklin's New Deal
- **Ex: Civil Rights Movement/Act**
	- should not be dealt with by Govt
	- shouldn't have done Voting Act
	- should be dealt w/ by the city/state, NOT govt!
		- *(Note: civil rights wouldn't have progressed if the govt hadn't passed the Voting Act... so...)*

### Intense AntiCommunism/patriotism, support for large military
- **wait, weren't liberals anti communist? weren't they the ones who came up with idea of Containment?**
- Conservatives: "*yes, but what is containment but a large federal govt with power???*"

- ***hate LBJ cause of great society,***
- ***BUT strongly support the Vietnam war effort!!!***
#### a. "big military" in a "small government?"

- believe we need a MASSIVE expansion on military!
- need high tech weapons to fight Soviets!
- Contradiction: if you're scared about big govt, why would you support large military powered Govt???
	- this leads to branching of Conservatives -> *Libertarians*

<span style="background:#fff88f">- Regardless, Idea is LOTS of ANTICOMMUNISM and PATRIOTISM</span>

### e. "Law and Order"
- "we need to crack down on crime and thugs "
- we need to unleash the POLICE
- "the police are the **THIN BLUE LINE** that keeps the country from Mayhem and Violence!"

- most conservatives argue that religion serves as important anchor for Society
	- gives us morality, stability, and hierarchy
- Primarily Protestant Christian

- not everybody religious
	- Barry Goldwater was not religious
	- some were anti-religious

- Economy and Taxes were an extremely important topic

- one thing that held conservatives together we're who they DIDN'T LIKE
	- hated hippies
	- hated LBJ
	- **HATED pres Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller (2 Conservatives)**

- **according to Conservatives, these guys are SELLOUTS, TRAITORS, practically DEMOCRATS**
	- *"we want a choice, not an echo!"*
- highway deal
- Nelson strong supporter of Civil Rights Movement

# Economists
- Conservatives
### Friedrich A. Hayek
- Conservatives wanted to support those who:
	- argued for privatization of things, not the govt
	- argued for small govt
- this guy was the epitome of this.
- Wrote book that argued:
	- **anytime govt gets involved in aggressively managing economy new deal, eventually you'll end up w/ dictatorship:**
		- either stalinism
		- or naziism
	- **govt will aggressively ask for more authority that next thing you know, they become authoritarian**
- Extremely popular book
### Milton Friedman
- also another communist
- argues that lots of things done by large govt should instead be done by private capitalism

### Ayn Rand
- anti-religious
- but very conservative

### Russell Kirk
- Argued Religion was Backbone of Society

### William F. Buckley
- MAJOR NAME in Conservative movement
- published magazine called "National Review"
- self unconscious Conservative 
- very funny, witty, funny Boston accent
- - Engaged in numerous public debates with figures across the political spectrum
- hated gor vidal
- <span style="background:#fff88f">spokesman for Conservative movment!</span>


### Young American for Freedom Magazine
- Young American for Freedom is what is to Conservatives what SDS is for New Left 

- go on protest about Vietnam.. but ITS A PRO-VIETNAM PROTEST
- image: look non-hippie, dressed up formally, "if you can't be with them, be for them!"
	- support the american troops fighting in Vietnam

- Want somebody to run for Presidential Election
	- don't want nelson rockefeller, nor barry goldwater

## Barry Goldwater
- born in arizona
- father owned department store
- was an air corps veteran
- did NOT like new deal or FDR
- runs for pres and WINS!
	- disliked New Deal
- treated his workers well
	- kinda naive to poor working conditions in coal mines
- hates COMMUNISM
- hates LBJ
- hates LIBERALS
- but friends w/ Kennedy?? surprisingly

- TL;DR:
	- get barry goldwater to run against JFK
(
- JFK wins
- is happy
- chill with JFK
- JFK asassinated
- LBJ comes to presidency
- hates LBJ
)

- Campaigns for presidency
- Staunch Anti-Communist

## Outcome of Election:
- Barry Goldwater gets his ass beat
- Incredibly Lopsided lmaooooo
	- Goldwater wins Arizona
	- Goldwater wins Deep South all at bottom right

- Reason why:
	- South was mostly white people
	- South is All Democrats
	- Who were the Republicans? Northern Party: they were the ones who
		- abolished slavery
		- tried to integrate
		- passed 14th and 15th American
		- to vote for Republicans was to vote against your own people!
		- "Yellow Dog Democrat":
			- "I'd rather vote for a Yellow Dog than a Republican"

- Also, Barry Goldwater is Half-Jewish
- Also, was a member of the NAACP:
	- helped desegregate arizona national guard, his country club in phoenix
	- was NOT a Segregationist!
	- Didn't seem likely to win in all these States
