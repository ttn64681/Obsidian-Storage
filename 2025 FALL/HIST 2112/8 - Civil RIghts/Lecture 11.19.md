# Ronald Reagan and the New Right
Reagan promises law and order in light of the radical antiwar protests

In 1970s, there was no way Reagan could have been elected because he was way too conservative.

## Reagan's Move to the Right in the 1950s
Motivation

- Friends with owner of General Electric who was a huge anti-union and anti-newdeal person
	- influenced by the people he's working for
- **Convinced that liberals are not doing enough in the face of communism**
	- *As a union member, he actually met some in hollywood* 
# 1960s - Reagan enters politics

# Four Reagan Administration goals
## Reducing Government
- **wants to reduce the size and strength of the government**
	- lower interference in economics
## Championing business
### Lower taxes, deregulation, anti-unionism
- *lower taxes on business and the wealthy*
	- not on middle class people
	- **argues trickle down economics** -> cut taxes of the rich so that they have more money to reinvest into their businesses to grow quickly -> create jobs and make up for tax cut
	- believed that the tax cut will pay for themselves
- *750 billion less dollars less in tax revenue*
	- how to make up for this?
- *limit government rules on environmental and safety regulations*
	- opposed to environmental federal protections
- *busted a union right off the bat*
## Aggressive Containment
### Reviving Patriotism?
Says that Vietnam was a noble cause and that we shouldn't be ashamed of it and argues that we lost due to internal traitors

People miss the feeling of being proud of their country
## Pushing "Traditional Values"
Pictures of Reagan with religious leaders
### The rise of the Religious Right

### Lip service?
Reagan was not that religious

Reagan did not actually shrink the size of the government like he said he would
# Liberals - down but not out
Liberals are still fighting
## Criticisms of "reaganomics"
What about tax cuts for middle class?
- tax refund for avg american was 50 bucks (assuming 25k annual income)

Money given to the states from the federal government are cut
- what does the state do? they raise taxes!
- thus taxes still being payed for average people, sometimes even more

Wealthy people did not reinvest their tax-cut money
- used it for unwise speculated investing

So government should cut spending right?
- nope Reagan increases military spending by like 40%
- so government has to borrow money to make up for tax cuts -> interest
- Reagan quadrupled the deficit
## Criticisms of foreign policy
Remembered for his involvment in the Cold War

People were furious with his intense anti-communist stance
- believed that he was a war monger

However he was actually savey and not a war monger
- he was very scared of nuclear war and wanted to get rid of nuclear weapons
### Negotiating with the Soviets - Reagan's rising historical stock
Negotiate weapons reduction with the Soviet Union

reagan and gorbachev work out a treaty to significantly reduce nuclear arsenal
- he supports Gorbachev (they liked each other)
### The embrace of "monolithic communism"
Continued bipartisan american tradition of containment
### Support for anticommunist dictators
Thus support almost anybody as long as they weren't communist
- supported dictators in centrla and south america as a result

People dont want another Vietnam but Reagan believed it was a noble cause and wasn't afraid to do it again
