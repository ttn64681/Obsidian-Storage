KKK resurgence:

## 2nd Reconstruction

### 1st Reconstruction
- some semblance of civil rights
- 14th amendment giving Americans birthright citizenship
- 15th amendment gave black men right to vote
- Lots of promises never kept
- Segregation
- Failed Reconstruction

Why are wwe now having Civil Rights Movement?
- we've aways had a civil rights movement
- real question: Why wasn't it until after WWII we start to see change/progress?

## WW2 Impacted Civil Rights Mvt
- donned a light on reality of world - White Supremacy - Nazi Germany
- WW2 causes a lot of Americans to look at themselves
- Lots of Black servicemen - who trained for incoming Nazi invasion in Europe, or in England for D-Day invasion - were segregated and had limited opportunities and jobs in army
	- Army run on a segregated, Southern, social network
	- But in England, it wasn't segregated, opened their eyes
		- "This is what life might be like if i lived in an unsegregated society"

## Cold War Impacted Civil Rights Mvt
- fighting against authoritarian dictatorship (Stalin, Soviet Union)
- how can US set itself up as bastion of freedom if they were segregating and discriminating against Black People?
- Communist Russian Propaganda about U.S. - Russian talking about Lynching
	- Stood around lynching bodies and took pictures
	- Took "collectibles" from body
- Didn't have to lie about racism about U.S., it was true

- U.S. can't talk about freedom and deny it to their own population
- U.S. needs to walk the walk
- made diplomacy difficult

## Imperialism Ends, Countries Go Independent
- WW2 ends imperialism
- Lots of African countries are going independent
- First thing U.S. does is ask Africans to come **help them w/ Cold War:**
	- U.S. literally has segregation
	- Only real supporters was in South Africa - which was White Supremacist ðŸ˜¹


- **How to take down Segregation and Racism? It's been structural for decades, +100 yrs**
	- *UNLEASH THE LAWYERS ->*
# The Legal Approach - early 1950s
## NAACP and Brown vs Board, 1954
### Cases for Educational Deprivation against Black People:
- **Linda Brown** lived in sight of white school but had to spend an hour to walk across railroads to get to school - due to segregation
- Hid Behind "Separate but Equal" Plessy v Ferguson clause
	- "They're not even equal!!! Black schools are underfunded...."
	- If they are separate, they're not even equal
- **Ruled -> Segregation in Public Schools is unconstitutional**
- Public Schools must be unsegregated w/ deliberate speed 
	- what is "deliberate speed?"
		- could be however long they wanted

- this ruling hits like a bomb shell
- if you can't defend segregation in public schools, then segregation won't exist at all
- White Supremacists - are shook, they vow to take down integration and Civil Rights Movement
- This leads to **"Massive Resistance"**
### a. "massive resistance"
- wasn't just KKK, it was educated people
#### i. George Wallace, Lester Maddox
- George Wallace - Governor of Alabama
	- "Segregation now, Segregation today, Segregation forever"
	- Students rioting
	- Shootouts at Ole Miss in 1962 Integration
- Lester Maddox - 
- **Little Rock Arkansas -**
	- 1956 - chose 9 black students to go to white school for first time
	- Angry White Mob
	- *Arkansas National Guard circled School to prevent the 9 black students to get in*
	- **Defying a unanimous Supreme Court ruling**
	- Infuriates Dwight Eisenhower
		- Doesn't care about Civil Rights Mvt, but cares about the law
		- Sends Federal Troops to remove the Guards
		- Sends 101st airborne unit to escort the 9 Black students 
	- Arkansas School shut down a year later as retaliation
	- UGA also almost shut down

#### Strategies - "school choice," segregation academies," etc.
- best ways to fight integration, was to make your opposition make it look like it was not about race, but about something else
- **"State's Rights"** to control their own destiny!
	- State's Rights dresses your argument up in Constitutional Clothing
- **"School's Choice"**
	- who would like to be the first black person at white school?
	- who would like to be the first white person at black school?
	- Segregation preserves itself - let tradition in fear of violence do the segregating for us.
		- "This is just purely choice! XD"
		- ***Makes you argue against freedom of choice***
- **Set up Private Schools**
	- not subject to Brown v Board rule
	- Could just set up high tuition to exclude Black People w/o ever mentioning race
- **Called Civil Rights Movements to be "Communist"**
	- Claimed MLK Jr was at Civil Rights School hanging out w/ known Communists
	- "Communists were trying to secretly create a giant Negro State where no White People were allowed"
		- Jarol K Smith

- **This is why Legal Battles are important to combat these strategies**

### Murder of Emmett Till, 1955
- Murdered and body was left
- Mother left the casket open and left the body is the same state it was found for the funeral
- Was a shocking
- **White people who did it were found not guilty**
	- "We absolutely did it"
- **Brown v Board did not save Emmet Till**

### We need to challenge system directly - Marches, Boycotts
- Montgomery refused to ride the bus - drove the bus company almost out of business, and became desegregated
- Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
	- **Sit-ins** - sit in white part of restaurant
		- Trained not to fight back, to not give ammunition to enemies
		- Pictures are impactful
	- >400 sit-ins 
	- Get beat up
	- Children hosed down
	- Guard Dogs
		- why are they getting beat-up for not doing anything

- Designed to embarrass the Liberal Govt to DO SOMETHING
- It's not just a moral thing, it's a STRATEGY
- Liberal Approach - Govt useful tool for change, Govt should flex its muscles
- Civil Rights mvt: "Where are you Govt???"
- Law enforcement won't protect you from Klan, b/c they ARE the Klan...
- Klansmen had secret agreement w/ Police to have 15 minutes to do whatever they wanted w/ Black People
	- Chains, Incendiary devices, beat them up

- Hospitals won't treat you if you're a Black Activist
	- White Civil Activitst Suffered nerve damage for rest of life, but got hospital treatment at least


- **Civil Rights Act of 1964:**
	- Bans segregation in public places
- **Voting Rights Act of 1965:**
	- One of several acts to prevent Black People from voting
	- Section 2 gutted 15 yrs ago
	- Section 4 allowing gerrymandering...
	- **This will likely to be gutted soon in present day...**
