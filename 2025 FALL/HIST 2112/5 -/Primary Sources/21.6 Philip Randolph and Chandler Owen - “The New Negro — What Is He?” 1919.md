A. Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen founded the Messenger in 1917 to provide an outlet for African American workers. The Messenger tackled issues of both race and class from a socialist perspective. It caused great controversy for its coverage of international issues, especially when it opposed U.S. involvement in World War I on pacifist grounds. **The following editorial from 1920 elaborates on the definition of the New Negro and argues for fundamental changes in the structure of American life and politics.**

---
- The emergence of a **radical, self-assertive, and politically/economically conscious African American identity**, challenging the traditional, conciliatory approach to race relations and demanding fundamental, systemic changes to achieve full equality in American life.

- **Defining the "New Negro":** What is the core difference between the emerging generation of African Americans (the "New Negro") and the previous generation (the "Old Negro") in their approach to civil rights and social change?
- **Beyond Patronage to Power:** How can African Americans move past being manipulated by established political parties (Republican and Democrat) through "political spoils and patronage," to actually achieving genuine political power, representation, and universal suffrage?
- **Radical Social and Economic Transformation:** What are the necessary, uncompromising steps—particularly in economics and social relations—that must be taken to dismantle systemic racism and achieve "absolute and unequivocal 'social equality'"?
- **Challenging the Stigma of Inferiority:** How does the acceptance of discriminatory practices, such as laws against intermarriage, inherently validate the idea of Black inferiority, and why must the "New Negro" actively reject this stigma? (The authors see the acceptance of such laws as "tantamount to the acceptance of the stigma of inferiority.")
### 1. Defining the "New Negro" (Political Differences)

**Question:** What is the core difference between the emerging generation of African Americans (the "New Negro") and the previous generation (the "Old Negro") in their approach to political action?

**Answer:**

|"Old Negro" Political Approach (Implicitly Rejected)|"New Negro" Political Approach (Demanded)|
|---|---|
|Could be "lulled" by **political spoils and patronage** (accepting small favors or jobs for votes).|**Cannot be bought**; demands that his vote is not priced by a job.|
|Accepted "political promissory notes" from parties that had failed them.|**Demands political equality** and refuses to accept unfulfilled promises from either party.|
|Had the right to _elect_ representatives but not to _select_ them (meaning the parties chose the candidates).|Stands for **universal suffrage** and recognizes the necessity of **selective as well as elective representation** to ensure real control over those in power.|

### 2. Economic and Social Aims

**Question:** What are the immediate economic and uncompromising social aims of the "New Negro"?

**Answer:**

|Area|Immediate Aims|Underlying Philosophy|
|---|---|---|
|**Economic (Worker)**|**More wages, shorter hours, and better working conditions** (demanding "the full product of his toil").|As a consumer, he seeks to buy goods at the lowest price.|
|**Social**|**Absolute and unequivocal "social equality."**|Equality cannot be "qualified"; a just society must be composed of social equals who receive "identity of social treatment."|

### 3. Challenging the Stigma of Inferiority (Intermarriage)

**Question:** How does the "New Negro" view laws against intermarriage, and why do they argue that intermarriage is a "logical, sound and correct aim"?

**Answer:**

- **View on Anti-Intermarriage Laws:** The "New Negro" maintains that accepting laws against intermarriage is the same as accepting the **"stigma of inferiority."**
    
- **Reasons for Intermarriage Aim:**
    
    1. It is the **only logical, sound and correct aim** to entertain.
        
    2. Laws against intermarriage **expose Negro women to sexual exploitation** (by white men).
        
    3. They **deprive the children** resulting from these mixed-race unions (mulattoes) of the right to inherit their white father's property.
