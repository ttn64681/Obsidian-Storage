(look at elc)

- Chinese were first group of people specifically targeted for anti immigrant/immigration rules

## Workingmen's Party
- Sole purpose was to send "Chinese back to China"
- **Pure goal was to prevent Chinese immigration**

# Why Chinese Immigrate to U.S.?
- Push and Pull Factors
- Push:
	- Ex: Jews in Russia, pushed out due to antisemitism
	- **Political Unrest**
		- The hayday of **european imperialsm** -
			- *European countries' efforts to take over (sometimes physically) other places in planet to suck as much wealth out of them as humanly possible*
			- EU countries will go to war with each other for this imperialistic efforts
			- CHINA - this was the ultimate goal b/c
				- so much potential
				- so much wealth
			- EU countries not string enough to take over China
			- Instead:
				- EU countries would pressure Chinese govt to give them access to Chinese small ports
				- "Colonial Ports"
		- **Boxer Rebellion -**
			- Chinese rebellion to kick European colonists out of China!!!
			- Some Chinese don't want to be in the middle of this so leave to U.S.! (Political Unrest)
		- **Opium Trade -** 
			- Chinese became addicted to Opium as result of British Imperialistic Efforts
			- Chinese want to escape this Opium takeover in China -> flee to U.S.

- Pull:
	- **Economic Attractions:**
		- Gold Mining / Gold Rush was very attractive in America
			- Get on a boat, grab a pick and shovel, and see if you can strike fortune!!!
		- The "Catch:"
			- The Gold Rush hype wasn't as prospective as Chinese thought -> Chinese immigrants seeking gold became **laborers** in ***mining camps***


## Chinese Laborers in Mining Camps:
- segregated
- You could feel the tension
### Americans feel job competition
- Americans don't like Chinese:
	- Chinese will work for nothing:
		- This results in depression of everyone's wage!
		- (Chinese work for dirt wage, causing overall wages to reduce)

## New Slavery
- Americans think to themselves:
- *Wages are so low because of Chinese competition that we'll become slaves ourselves! It's the "New Slavery"*
- This results in Americans such as Governor John Bigler forming the anti-Chinese immigration party ->

## California Workingmen's Party
- Chinese move to other job opportunities
	- Laundry businesses:
		- Chinese workers would go to laundry businesses after railroads were done being built
- Chinese Railroad workers
- Famous Unfinished Railroad: Union Pacific
- Work in Nevada:
	- Super hot desert
	- unwanted rugged land
	- govt would test nuclear weapons there


# Railroads and Immigration
## Cheap and reliable labor for the transcontinental railroad
- Railroad companies LOVED the Chinese because of cheap and reliable labor

## The Burlingame Treaty (1868)
- **Encourages Chinese immigration**
- Gave Chinese special nation status
- Gave them special trade deals
- **Allows American Railroad Owners to pay  lower wages!!!!**

### Workingmen's Party Hates This Treaty!!!
- Why do this? This is unproductive!!!
## Chinese Sharecroppers and Landowners
- Some Southern States invited Chinese to the South to be Landowners
- Why? Because Americans wanted to regain control, and Chinese were considered "Easy to Control"
- ( This never really happened...)

## Other Immigrant Groups Also Feel Anti-Chinese
- **Immigrant groups turn on each other**
	- Irish immigrants don't like Chinese, because they were threats to their job (due to competition)
- **"Some immigrants are good, some immigrants are bad"**

## 7 Years Later: The Page Act of 1875
- Banned Chinese Women from coming into the U.S.
- Goal: Anti-Chinese Act 
	- The reason they proposed was that "Chinese Women were coming to U.S. to become dirty sex workers," so then, without Chinese women, Chinese men would become sexually frustrated and go home (LMAO)

# Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
- *Bans all Chinese from Immigration!!!*
- **Chinese people cannot be Citizens of the United States**
- "Ruin to White Labor"
- "Brought Immorality"
- "Brought Diseases"
- Laundry businesses want to replace Chinese laundry workers with Washing Machines to chase Chinese out!!!

- Loopholes existed, Chinese could go to certain states to dodge this act...
- U.S. later plugs these loopholes

### Not everyone is Anti-Chinese
- Other immigrants, like Irish, think:
	- "If you can keep out Chinese immigrants, **whose next?** How long until they turn on us?"

## "Permission" for Violence
- Purges in Tacoma, WA, Eureka, CA, and Rock Springs, WY
- Parallels w/ race in the American South

# Fighting Back Against Chinese Exclusion Act
## Lawsuits and the 14th Amendment
### Yick Wo. vs. Hopkins
- San Francisco city had lots of laundry businesses
- SF city govt said: "any laundry building made of wood must have permit to operate"
	- for "fire safety"
	- **Also served another purpose to attack Chinese laundry businesses**
	- *Chinese were poor so couldn't afford stone/concrete buildings*
- Law seemed to be benign but had dirty goals underneath
- John Hopkins:
- This is clearly interfering with free enterprise: This will not stand!"
	- Big victory for Chinese and civil rights

### Wong Kim Ark vs US (1898)
- kid born in U.S.
- parents retire and go back to China
- kid wants to visit parents in Chinese
- kid returns to America and was not let back in: "You're not a citizen, you're Chinese :/"
- **Problem: 14th Amendment - If you're born in U.S., you are a citizen!!!**

# Extending the Exclusion Act
## Angel Island (1910-40)
- Chinese still come to U.S., perhaps because they didn't understand the act or hadn't heard of it
- Chinese would be redirected (essentially held hostage) to "Angel Island"
- Bored as hell, waiting for weeks until sent back home

## Immigration Act of 1924
- 1924 - the peak of immigration
- Immigration Act of 1924 - 
	- All (major) Asian people are banned from U.S.!!!
		- Includes All Major Regions of Asia: Vietnam, Indonesia, Korea, China, India, Laos, Cambodia, etc...
- Northwestern Europeans are allowed
- Eastern European immigrants are often banned still though...

# Lasts until 1965:
- Lyndon Johnson ends this act
