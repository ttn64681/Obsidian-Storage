## 1. Settlement Houses - Hull House, etc.
- Jane Adams goes to Chicago
- found **"Hull House"**
	- community center built in middle of poor immigrant neighborhood

### Good Side of Hull House
- They provide services to the local immigrants:
	- Education
	- Classes on anything and everything
	- Social sing-alongs, sporting events, cooking, sewing, choir, wrestling
	- Hassled the local govt, going after the city of Chicago and their political machines to get them to do things that actually provide for their citizens
- Francis Perkins - first ever president cabinet member started in Hull House

### Bad Side of Hull House
- Downsides towards "Hull House" - correcting Immigrant culture
	- "Immigrants don't cook the right way"
	- "Immigrants need fixing, we need "
