A Piedmont Pandemic: the 1918-1919 Influenza Epidemic in Athens, Georgia

Ran out of caskets due to the amount of deaths..
# The "Spanish Flu" in global context
Killed roughly 30 - 100 million people
## Origins
Hits in 1918, last year of world war one.

Typically start off as diseases from animals

Exact origins are unknown
- believed to come form animals -> soldiers who are camped tighly together + weak immune system due to being exhausted -> soldiers move all over due to the war -> flu spreads
### The Role of WWI
While the war is happening, the news is dominated by WWI.
- the news is censored heavily (back then)
- "bad news" is not allowed in the news papers
- Spanish were not involved in the war
	- called Spanish flu because they wren't involved in the war so they were able to publicize the flu
- not sure where the flu originated from

The war helped facilitate the spread of the flu.

Soldiers coming into medical barracks and dying the next day.
- no technology back then to detect viruses
## Three Waves
1918-1919
## The W-shaped mortality curve
Normally if you get the flu, you do not want to be really young or really old because thats where death usually occurs with the flu.

However with the Spanish Flu, "healthiest ages" are suffering almost as badly as other demographics.
- average age of death was 34 (shocking!)
- targeted people like soldiers (healthy, young men)
# The history of epidemics in Athens
Athens has had lots of epidemics
- mostly smallpox

Pest House
- you could hire an armed guard to wave people off from your property to avoid disease
- if you didnt have money, youd be put into a Pest House (quarantine)
	- you either died or got better 
	- poor black people ended up in Pest Houses
## The ecology of segregation
Athens up until 1918 was a segregated town
- 67% of black women who lived in this town were laundrists 
- believed that "servants" were bringing in disease

Highschool segregated
- cooking program ran by white and black progressivists
- taught to cook in a hygienic way to avoid introducing diseases

News is also segregated
- white newspaper typically portrayed blacks in negative light
	- said that blacks were spreading diseases
- poor man's plight held up for people to laugh at
## Disease and race
Racialization of disease
- strong belief that black people were bringing disease
- concerns about cleanliness among the black people and their responsibility for the disease
- true that there is a higher incidence of disease among black pop. in Athens
	- there were geographical reasons
	- sandborne map
		- sandborne fire insurance company
		- keen interest in fire safety, need to know a lot about buildings theyre insuring and the buildings surrounded them
		- created detailed maps of what the towns looked like, especially in building districts
			- recorded floor, fire safety equipemen, windows, who owns, name of bus
		- athens sandborne map 
	- athens is a segregated city
		- lands that are badly drained, on a hill, or inconveniently located away from downtown, odds are (less desirable land) theyre cheaper so black people live there since its affordable
		- bad drainage -> sewer system only exists in white neighborhoods
		- black communities had to use outhouses 
			- lots of flies that could spread disease
			- hole of waste often seeped into local drinking water
		- hard physical labor jobs for blacks
			- women cleaning
			- men cotton, delivering things, physically active
		- not a coincidence that blacks are more prone to disease
		- whites blame blacks based on race, not on actual circumstances



# The Flu Comes to Athens
American newspapers are censored, as the Spanish Flu is approaching across the world, no one is aware.
- eventually it comes closer and starts to appear in the news
- moves from the back to the front of the news paper
## Approach and arrival
### Warnings from the Red Cross
Red Cross warns of incoming disease.
- need to make 10,000 masks to give out
- give out to UGA (entirely composed of men, ROTC)
- but its too late
- following monday, report of several uga students getting sick
- several are quarantined in peabody hall


## "October is the cruelest month"
### The city's response
Closes schools, churches, pool rooms, movies, carnivals, etc.
## Second wave
## An epidemic ends
# Analyzing the results
## Raw numbers and the probem of records
## "Guestimates"
Professor Drake guestimates that as high as 84 deaths
- black people did not die at a higher rate despite their poverty
	- their death was proportional to their population
