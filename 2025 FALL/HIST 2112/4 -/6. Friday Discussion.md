- **Nature largely affects American History**
	-  *we've seen this via COVID*
	- **we see the same thing with Spanish Flu effectively incapacitating Woodrow Wilson for a WHOLE YEAR!!!**

- 7 times more people died from "Spanish" Flu than WWI

## Woodrow Wilson - The Progressive
- All you need is science and a non-corrupt government
- *"If you follow my plan (the British and French), we may never have a war again!!!"*
	- **Spoiler alert: They did NOT follow the plan**

- If Woodrow Wilson had been in better health, would he have been to manage Europe more successfully?
	- Stroke due to Spanish Flu - basically useless
		- His WIFE became the defacto president who helped run the country

## Imperialism
- Much of American history is **ANTI-IMPERIALISTIC**
	- throwing out the British
- We need a good reason if they want America to be imperialistic
	- Economic reasons:
		- take their resources
			- lots of tropical places have rubber like Philippines
			- GOOD access to trade, since it becomes YOUR colony so you can get people to buy YOUR stuff!
				- ex: U.S. 
	- **Cartoon:**
		- Filipino depicted like child to counter the anti-imperialistic argument that they are adults!
		- is depicted as generally not self-governing or capable of self-governance, in need of guidance, similar to Indians and others whom the U.S. tried to assimilate
		- American Imperialists didn't want to leave the Philippines to the Spanish
			- wouldn't you rather be imperialized by US?
		- Some Imperialists we're anti-Imperialist for ugly reasons:
			- they wouldn't understand our efforts anyways (cynical outlook, give up)

- White Man's Burden:
	- written by a British person
	- "Go and join and be like us"
	- **Masculinity:**
		- It is a man's duty to grow up and do this hard task and take on this thankless ordeal...
		- We've gotten soft, not worthy of legacy of our ancestors, weak from luxury... "have done with childish days -- "
		- regain manhood
