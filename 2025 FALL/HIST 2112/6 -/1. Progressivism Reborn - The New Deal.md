# Background
- Great Depression is the single most important event in American History
	- More important than WW2
- Most important president during Great Depression / WW1 is Franklin Delano Roosevelt

- Washington Monuments
	- Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt (Rocky, nature, waterfall)

# Progressivism Reborn: The New Deal

# Franklin Delano Roosevelt - American Savior, American Satan?
- Most important President of 20th century
- Him and his cabinet (The New Dealers) led the way through Depression
- Overwhelmingly popular, (even annoyingly popular)

- Post-war Liberalism
- Roosevelt is a Liberal

## Liberalism in America
- America needs lots of reforms and regulations
- Believes in a powerful govt as a **useful tool for change**
	- Govt should flex its muscles and get things done!!!
		- Duty to...
		- **Similar idea to Progressivists -**
			- *Government was key to fighting back Industrialism*
			- *Progressivism - The Final Anti-Industrialism Group*

### Liberalism, the Rebirth of Progressivism!

- 1933
	- Franklin mentions, the only thing to fear is fear itself
	- People were so gripped with despair
	- Govt had duty to lift people's spirits up

- Polio - paralyzed in legs

## The Great Depression
### 1932 - Worst Year of Depression
- **Unemployment rate was 25%**
	- an additional 25% are underemployed
	- Half of entire workforce is basically not working full time
- **Stock market lost value 90%**
	- Manufacturers stop making cars
		- *No workers, No buyers*


# Hoover and the Depression - the laissez-faire approach
## Laissez-faire approach
- Republican
- Not an evil man but Not seen as a capable president
	- Economic Depressions happen
	- **laissez-faire approach**
		- not appropriate for Govt to mess w/ economy in major way
		- "*Help Us!"* **"I Can't and I Wont..."**
		- Hoovervilles - cardboard boxes
## 1) "Voluntary Corporation"
- Hoover says it is **"NOT the role of the Govt to help those who are suffering economically"**
- Who should help them? **"Help should come from Private Operations"**
	- *Churches, Charities, City/State Govts*
	- Federal govt has NO BUSINESS in meddling with economic affairs of people

- NOT SUITABLE for Great Depression
- Normally, economy does bounce back, but not this type of societal collapse
## 2 ) Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)
### Hoover's Failures :
- Raises tariffs on imported goods 
- tax on imports raises price of imported goods, which causes people to instead buy local goods...
- *Gate-keeping external goods causes other countries to retaliate and add tariffs on their imported goods*
	- **America now has it harder to import outside goods**

### 1932 - Reconstruction Finance Corporation 
- Gives loans to businesses
	- **"Bailout loans"**
- **Government starts getting into construction business**
	- Hoover wants govt to build airports and highways, why?
		- More employment
## 3 ) "Too Little Too Late"
- **"Priming the Pump"**
	- *"Have to spend some money to earn some money"*
	- Putting money into construction
	- Does not help much, *Too Late*

### a) Bonus Army
- **govt paid soldiers for their service in LAND**
	- later on switch to money payments
- **So after WW1, how to pay all these soldiers back?**
	- Pass **"Bonus Army Act"** - 24 yrs from now, we will give veterans a big chunk of money as payment
		- Why wait? why not now? B/c there's no Social Security
		- Often times when old, you'd run out of money and still be alive, and you'd be screwed
		- This 24 yr buffer was a way to prevent that
- **Problem:** *NOBODY EXPECTED GREAT DEPRESSION TO HAVE* üò≠üôèüôèüôèüíî

#### Mass Marches and Camping at D.C.
- **Soldiers don't get money, and form Mass Marches**
	- PROTEST at DC for bonus
	- set up Hooverville style camps
	- We're run with good procedure
	- very respectably run
	- good relationships with the police
- **Wait for vote for Bonus Army Bill**
	- *Spoiler alert: they don't get it*
		- <font color="#ffff00">not enough money</font>

#### Hoover's Response
- Get's pissed and tired of soldiers
- **Orders police and army to move in and get rid of these guys**
	- The guy in charge of this, a future legend in WW2, **Douglas McArthur**, was NOT FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE
	- he EXCEEDED his orders and went into camps to physically throw them out
- **BURNS** *their settlements*

#### Hoover's Political Disaster
- POLITICAL DISASTER 
- basically a dead man walking
- Roosevelt said "I knew I'd won after seeing that"

![[Election of 1932.png]]

- Republican Candidate couldn't even win his own County (üíÄ wrap it up)

# The New Deal
- Franklin: We need action
	- **Needs presidential power like they were at war**
	- I'm NOT gonna sit around and do NOTHING
	- "The only thing to fear is fear itself"

- The Plan against the New Depression is called **"The New Deal"**
## 1) Five Agendas:
### a) Relieve immediate suffering
- Person are starving, have "the Rickets", lack of vitamin-D
- **Address the MOST DESPERATE** 
	- **Not only because its the right thing to do, but for political stability**
	- People we're looking to dictatorships for an answer to their sufferings
		- People in times of crisis either look to Right-wing Fascist or Left-wing Fascist
		- dictatorship was a big-deal, saying democracy didn't work
	- 
### b) save banks, increase money supply
- 
### c) jumpstart industry
- get factories up and working again
### d) address the agricultural crisis
- Address the farmers, roosevelt has soft-spot for farmers
### e) "make-work" programs to restore morale
- Finally, restore morale, make people believe again
