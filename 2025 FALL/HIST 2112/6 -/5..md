# Outline

# The New Deal and the origins of "Liberalism"
- New Deal Mobilized Army
- Liberalism - Wanting the Govt to Flex Their Muscles!!!

# Depression and the Rise of Fascism and Militarism
## Rise to Nazi Germany
- Germany after WWI, said the US didn't win, but Germany quit
- After WWI, Germany's economy was in shambles, inflation was outta control
- Treaty of Versailles - Peace Treaty that forced Germany to pay back the French and British for all the damage Germany caused
- With people in such low spirits, people wanted for a leader a- 
	- *"Simple Man, with Simple Solutions"*

- Hitler was in WWI
	- Afterwards, he feels "betrayed"
	- Eventually is elected by German people

- Fascism vs Communism
	- Fascism lot more racist
	- Nazis were white supremacists

## Nazi Invasion
- Austria welcomed the Nazis with open arms
	- Nazis marched in and took over Poland w/o a single shot
- 1939 Nazi Germany - invades Poland -> 
	- 1940 - failed to invade Britain
		- air invasion - beat up so bad
	- 1941 - Take over France
	- Attack Soviet Union, which violated Peace Treaty
	- Went down to Africa
- **1942 - Most of Europe taken over by Nazis**

- WWII finally starts

## Rise of Japanese Empire 
- Japan starts to become imperialist
	- Don't have resources to become an empire, e.g. Rubber
	- **Imperialism - "Sucking the resources out of other places"**
	- *"Rape of Nanking"*

- Would justify it by saying "We're leading East Asia to Greatness!!"
	- No, it was imperialism. Ask the Chinese

- Pearl Harbor - killed 50 people ->
- FDR - U.S. entered War ->
- Germany - officially declares War on U.S.

# Preparing for War
- Just had a Depression, and remember WWI, people don't want to have another War

## a) Isolationism *redux*

## b) The attractions of consumerism

# Mobilizing for The Big One
## a) The problem of mobilization in a democracy
- Your freedoms don't disappear just b/c ur in a war
	- Can't be like Hitler and force people to make all the weapons for him

- Charm people, tempt people to mobilize, NOT FORCING THEM
	- -> This is accomplished by The New Deal

## b) The New Deal incentives
- didn't force people to do things
- tried to get voluntary cooperation
- *Offering "incentives"*

### War Production Board (WPB)
-  Get govt bureaucracies to Oversee Mobilization
- Put business executives in charge of govt organizations
	- Put "Sears" head in charge of one
	- Henry's Son becomes head of one
		- Henry Ford was still selling to Germany ðŸ˜­

- In charge of having people make War Weapons/Vehicles/etc.

- **Guaranteed a PROFIT**
	- *"We'll pay you to make the weapons PLUS extra"*
		- **Cost Plus Incentive**
	- *"We'll pay for your factory costs"*
	- "When war ends, we'll sell YOU factories for cheap!"
	- "Factories that you already own, you have to retool them to make civilian things... We'll offer you low-interest loan to allow you to go back to re-civilian things"

- **By end of war, you have "new factories, new tools, more money, and no bills to pay"**
- Americans start lining up!

### Mass Producing Weapons
- We could make aircrafts faster than they can be shot down
- Flood enemies w/ Industrial Might!
- 80% of military goes to Europe

# The New Deal goes to War:
## a) Carrots and Sticks: "Voluntary cooperation" and military necessity

## b) War Production Board and (later) the Office of War Management

## c ) War Manpower Commission
## d ) Office of Price Administration
## e ) CCC and TVA

<hr>

- ***The New Deal was great practice*** for this voluntary mobilization with Franklin's Jobless Army
- The CCC was run by the Army
- Army runs it Army-style!

<hr>

- Massive amounts of aluminum for Electricity for War Efforts
- Gotten from Dams in places near Pacific Northwest
	- Environmental issues, but helped win the war

# Women in War
## Rosie the Riveter
- Like Uncle Sam
- "We Can Do It!"

- Flyers printed out by hand
- Govt had room full of women w/ typewriters to print out Flyers

### "Femininity in the Factories"
- Rosy cheeks in the factory
- "You can still work in a factory and 'not lose your femininity'"
- Women polishing nose cones of aircrafts

- Old and young people in factories

- African American Opportunities weren't that great
	- 2/3 of Athens AA population were doing domestic services for white people
		- Sharecropping, etc.
- Huge for employment opportunities!
	- Pay was good!
- 

# Nativism, Again
## a) Japanese internment
- Recall biggest wave of immigration prior to 1920s being banned

## Assimilation -  Cementing American status
- For immigrant workers like Polish workers:
	- **War was their formative experience as an American**
	- "You can never doubt our Americanness again, so don't tell us we don't belong here!"
	- Huge for American-Immigrant workers

## ...Except for Japanese 
### Japanese Internment Camps
- HOWEVER, if you were a Japanese-American, you were cooked
- FDR
	- signed an executive order ->
	- orders all people of Japanese ancestry to report to internment camps
	- Given a WEEK
		- You have no choice but to abandon your things
		- All your businesses and buildings and valuables get stolen by locals...
- Americans scared of American Spies
	- This was untrue, since Japan considered Japanese-American Immigrants *traitors*

## But, Lack of Manpower -> Japanese employment ...
- Even so, need for military manpower was so bad, army would invite the young Japanese-American men in internment camps

Japanese people in Hawaii was not taken due to logistical impossibility (70% of japanese people there)
- same reason for nazi sympathizeers not interned
