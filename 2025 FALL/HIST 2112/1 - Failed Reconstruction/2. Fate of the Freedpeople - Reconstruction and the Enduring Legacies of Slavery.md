IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS:

- What does it mean to be free as a freedman? Well nothing really, as long as you are black.
*"**Reconstruction failed to deliver true economic and social liberation to African Americans**, instead ushering in new, insidious systems that perpetuated dependency and racial hierarchy, building directly on the legacy of slavery."*

## Reconstruction & Legacies of Slavery: Cheat Sheet

**Big Picture:** Emancipation didn't bring true freedom; instead, new systems emerged to maintain racial hierarchy and economic control, echoing slavery.

---

**Key Themes & Connections:**

1.  **The Enduring Legacy of Slavery:**
    *   **Connection:** Slavery's economic/social power (planter elite, "social floor" for poor whites) laid the groundwork for post-war control.
    *   **Transition:** Southern goal: "recreating the slave system w/o slavery."

2.  **Freedmen's Aspirations vs. Reality:**
    *   **Aspirations:** Searching for family, education, churches, politics, and especially **independent "yeoman" farming (land ownership)**.
    *   **Reality:** "Nothing But Freedom" – legal freedom but **no land, no money**, only "LABOR." This disparity creates the "problem of making a living."

3.  **Economic Exploitation & Dependency (Sharecropping):**
    *   **Context:** White planters need cheap labor; freedmen need work.
    *   **"Solution":** **Sharecropping System** – meant to split profits (50/50 in theory), but in practice led to **"Debt Peonage" and the "sharecropping trap."**
    *   **Impact:** Replaced forced labor of slavery with economic dependency, preventing wealth accumulation.

4.  **Continuum of Oppression:**
    *   **Evolution:** Black Codes (initial restrictions) -> Sharecropping (economic re-subjugation) -> Jim Crow (later, more pervasive segregation/disenfranchisement).
    *   **Goal:** All aimed at limiting Black freedom and maintaining white supremacy after slavery.

5.  **The Unfinished Struggle for Freedom:**
    *   **Central Question:** What does freedom mean without economic independence or full rights?
    *   **Outcome:** Despite the end of slavery, the fight for genuine equality and land ownership remained largely unfulfilled due to these new systems of control.
