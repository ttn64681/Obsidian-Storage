Richard H. Cain - ***Federal Aid for Land Purchase***, 1868

**Richard H. Cain, a free black minister** raised in Ohio, went to South Carolina after the war and **served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives** for two terms in the 1870s. The following excerpt comes from a *speech* Cain made in 1868 as a representative to the South Carolina constitutional convention. *Cain proposed that the convention petition Congress for a $1 million loan to purchase land that could be resold to freedmen at a reasonable price.*

I believe the best measure to be adopted is to bring capital to the State, and instead of causing revenge and unpleasantness, I am for even-handed justice. I am for allowing the parties who own lands to bring them into the market and sell them upon such terms as will be satisfactory to both sides. I believe a measure of this kind has a double effect: first, it brings capital, what the people want; second, it puts the people to work; it gives homesteads, what we need; it relieves the Government and takes away its responsibility of feeding the people; it inspires every man with a noble manfulness, and by the thought that he is the possessor of something in the State; it adds also to the revenue of the country. By these means men become interested in the country as they never were before.… I will also guarantee that after one year’s time, the Freedman’s Bureau will not have to give any man having one acre of land anything to eat.
