**Property Holding:** Freedpeople considered property holding (especially land) a fundamental right because it represented true independence, economic self-sufficiency, dignity, and a tangible break from the legacy of slavery where they owned nothing.

- **Richard Cain (14.7):** Would likely present Black politicians as capable, intelligent, and legitimate leaders working to uplift their communities and contribute to stable governance.
- **Thomas Nast (14.10):** Portrays Black politicians as caricatured, incompetent, chaotic, and immoral, "aping the lowest Whites," and disgracing their race.

- **Resistance (14.9):** While Ellen Parton's testimony vividly describes the terror and violence of the Klan, her very act of testifying before Congress is a profound form of resistance. It demonstrates the courage of African Americans to speak out against injustice, appeal for federal protection, and seek redress through official channels, despite immense personal risk.


- **Limitations of Federal Policies:**
    - **No Land Redistribution:** Failed to provide land, leaving freedpeople economically dependent.
    - **Insufficient Enforcement:** Federal troops and judicial oversight were inadequate and withdrawn too early.
    - **Shifting Political Will:** Northern public and political fatigue led to waning support.
    - **Scope:** Focused more on political rights than addressing underlying economic inequality or deep-seated racism.
- **Challenges to Implementation:**
    - **White Southern Resistance:** Organized, violent opposition (KKK) and political intransigence (Democratic "Redemption").
    - **Pervasive Racism:** Deep-seated racism in both South and North hindered the acceptance of racial equality.
    - **Economic Realities:** The South's agrarian economy and planter class resistance made fundamental change difficult.
    - **Federal vs. State Power:** Ongoing constitutional debates over the extent of federal authority in state affairs. *(Dred Scott Michigan)*

**Nast's Cartoon Suggests:** *Dying Northern views, accepting racist narratives,* By 1874, white Northern attitudes were shifting, showing disillusionment with Reconstruction, an increasing acceptance of racist Southern narratives about "Black Rule," *a belief in Black political inferiorit*y, and a desire for Black people to return to a subservient role, leading to a withdrawal of support for federal intervention

Thomas Nast began drawing for the popular magazine Harper’s Weekly in 1859. Nast initially used his illustrations to rouse northern public sentiment for the plight of blacks in the South after the Civil War. By 1874, however, many Northerners had become disillusioned with federal efforts to enforce Reconstruction. Like them, Nast accepted the white southern point of view that “Black Reconstruction” was a recipe for corruption and immorality. The figure of Columbia (at the top right) represents the nation, and the caption captures the view of many Northerners by 1874: “You are Aping the lowest Whites. If you disgrace your Race in this way you had better take Back Seats.”
The magazine cover of Harper's Weekly shows an illustration titled, “Colored Rule in a Reconstructed (?) State.” The illustration shows congressional chambers where caricatured black men argue while white men and Columbia look on with disdain.
Interpret the Evidence

How did black codes and sharecropping agreements (Sources 14.6 and 14.8) attempt to reimpose bondage on the formerly enslaved? How did they differ from pre-Civil War slave laws?
    Why did freedpeople consider property holding a fundamental right and to what extent did sharecropping agreements allow them to gain some economic benefits from their labor (Sources 14.7 and 14.8)?
    Contrast the image of South Carolina’s black politicians presented in Richard Cain’s speech (Source 14.7) and Thomas Nast’s cartoon (Source 14.10). What does Nast’s cartoon suggest about white northern attitudes toward freedpeople in the South by 1874?
    Despite the fear and physical danger caused by the Ku Klux Klan, what does the testimony of Ellen Parton (Source 14.9) reveal about black attempts to resist it?

Put It in Context

How much did Reconstruction transform the South and the nation?

What were the greatest limitations of federal Reconstruction policies and the greatest challenges to implementing them?
