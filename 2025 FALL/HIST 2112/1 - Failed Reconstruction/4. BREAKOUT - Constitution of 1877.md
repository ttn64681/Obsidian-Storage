## End of Reconstruction
- At the same time of Compromise of 1877:
	- In order for Southerners/Democrats to vote for Rutherford Hayes (Republican Pres), North had to remove all Union federal troops from South 
	- End of Reconstruction

## Rewriting of Constitution - 1877
- Provided electoral voting rights if:
	- **"have lawfully served in xyz wars"**
		- MYTH: NO CONFEDERATE BLACK TROOPS
			- instead, body servants, enslaved troops forced to fight
	- **"lawfully descended from those who fought in xyz wars"**
		- doesn't qualify mixed races or AA's
	- **"have at least x amount of land and are English literate**
		- GOAL: disenfranchise those w/o land and are illiterate
			- mainly consisted of freedman / African Americans

- **they have to go through these complications instead of EXPLICITLY DISALLOWING BLACK PEOPLE to vote b/c of 13th and 14th Amendment!!!!**

- Dred Scott - single worst court law
	- Dred Scott was freed once he touched Michigan soil
	- Court challenged this, **saying its unconstitutional since can't interfere w/ property rights**
	- Dred Scott wasn't a Michigan citizen since he wasn't born there

- Women can't vote until 1900s

- **Doesn't these qualifications impact poor white people?**
	- *Bar for voting was lower for white people*
	- **Grandfather clause:**
		- if grandfather could vote, you could vote
		- if they were veteran, they could vote

## AA's use American Rhetoric

AA's create Convention of Colors:
- speak w/ inspiration drawn from Declaration of independence
- "all free governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed"
- "no taxation w/o representation"

"WHO'S AN AMERICAN, AND WHAT MAKES SOMEONE AN AMERICAN?"

## Land - the key to freedom
- Land was the key to freedom, people wnated more than anything, land
- AA's wanted to be self-sufficient
- When you have a farm, you have control of your own life
