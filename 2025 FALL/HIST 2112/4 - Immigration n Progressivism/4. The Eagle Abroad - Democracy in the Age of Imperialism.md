# Introduction
Imperialism: extending the power of your country beyond your borders to take control of outside regions in order to suck as much money and resources from those countries as much as you can

# Why American Imperialism?
- We've always leaned Anti-Imperial
	- Overthrew British
- **Pro-Imperialist argument:** "Now that we've achieved Imperial Might, it's time for us to do the same thing as Europe, and to have the same thing that Europe has (colonies)"

## 1) Access to Markets
- money is attractive
- Farmers have a lot of produce
- **China is especially prospective**
	- 6-8 million Chinese people *(potential consumers)*

## Philippines - bought for $20 million
- Also, America pays the Spanish to let us Buy the Philippines - 

## Anti-Imperialist don't buy this:
- **treating and depicting the imperialized and colonized as children when they are FULL GROWN ADULTS**
	- *STOP INFANTILIZING THEM*

- **Political Cartoon:**
	- Misbehaving half-devil/half-child, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Philippines
	- Uncle Sam as the Teacher Disciplining the Children
	- Text says: "It's okay to do this without consent since they are not fully developed countries"

## **SOooo.... are the colonized Citizens now???**
### Insular Cases:

	- They are citizens, but don't have full rights like those at home

***Example: Puerto Rico:***
- YOU DON'T GET TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT	
- **no full suffrage rights**
- Debate to make Puerto Rico to make them the 51st federal state
	- drawbacks, expensive to pay taxes, etc.

# Philippines - America as the new Spain
- if you were Philippines, you loved to see US kicking out Spanish rule:
- but are you gonna leave now?
	- American Intention is not to leave... 

- **Americans kick out Spanish but replace them with the Philippines**

## Philippino War
