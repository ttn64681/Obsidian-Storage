- No figure became more synonymous with the Harlem Renaissance than Langston Hughes. 
- **simultaneously gave voice to the historical anxieties that African Americans faced and celebrated the roles of blacks in the arts.** 

- **The Negro Speaks of Rivers," is a foundational text of the Harlem Renaissance that creates a deep, timeless, and global Black identity.**
- **It directly counters the racist narrative that Black history began with slavery by connecting the African American soul to the very dawn of human civilization.**

### Tracing a Global Heritage
Hughes uses four rivers to trace a historical and spiritual journey that spans continents and millennia:
- **The Euphrates:** By placing the Black soul at the cradle of civilization in Mesopotamia, Hughes asserts that Black history is synonymous with human history itself.
- **The Congo and the Nile:** These rivers ground the identity in Africa, linking the "New Negro" to a powerful homeland ("lulled me to sleep") and a magnificent ancient civilization ("raised the pyramids"). This is a direct expression of the Harlem Renaissance's focus on celebrating a "shared African heritage".
- **The Mississippi:** This river brings the journey to America, connecting the ancient soul to the experience of slavery and the promise of emancipation ("when Abe Lincoln / went down to New Orleans").

By linking these rivers, Hughes creates an unbroken historical line from Africa to America, portraying the African American experience not as a tragedy, but as one part of a long, profound, and resilient history.

- Hughes defines the "New Negro" through **cultural and spiritual depth.** The "New Negro" is not just politically assertive, but is also a being with a soul "grown deep like the rivers," rooted in history and possessing a profound spiritual life.
- **The Foundation for Equality:** By establishing an identity that is ancient, powerful, and fundamental to human history, Hughes’s poem makes an artistic argument that Black people are inherently worthy of the political, economic, and social equality demanded by activists like Randolph and Owen.

I’ve known rivers:

I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of

human blood in human veins.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.

I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.

I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.

I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln

went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy

bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

I’ve known rivers:

Ancient, dusky rivers.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

### Explain how Langston Hughes appeals to history to lend insight into the experiences of Africans in America (Source 21.8).

Langston Hughes uses a direct connection to **ancient and enduring world rivers** to root the African American experience in a history far older and more profound than slavery:

- **Ancient Heritage:** By claiming to have "known rivers ancient as the world" and connecting his soul's depth to them, Hughes instantly establishes a heritage of **timeless wisdom and spiritual depth.**
    
- **Civilizational Contribution:** He asserts that Black people were **active shapers of world history**, claiming a presence at the dawn of civilization (bathing in the **Euphrates**) and involvement in great feats of engineering (raising the **pyramids** above the **Nile**). This contradicts the racist narrative of Black inferiority.
    
- **Connecting Past to Present:** The poem ties this deep, ancient history to the African diaspora in America by referencing the **Congo** (the ancestral home) and the **Mississippi** (the site of American slavery and migration). By blending these images, Hughes gives the African American identity a sense of **powerful, enduring historical legitimacy** that fuels their resilience and pride in the present.
