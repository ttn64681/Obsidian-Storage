- No figure became more synonymous with the Harlem Renaissance than Langston Hughes. 
- **simultaneously gave voice to the historical anxieties that African Americans faced and celebrated the roles of blacks in the arts.** 

- Hughes defines the "New Negro" through **cultural and spiritual depth.** The "New Negro" is not just politically assertive, but is also a being with a soul "grown deep like the rivers," rooted in history and possessing a profound spiritual life.
- **The Foundation for Equality:** By establishing an identity that is ancient, powerful, and fundamental to human history, Hughes’s poem makes an artistic argument that Black people are inherently worthy of the political, economic, and social equality demanded by activists like Randolph and Owen.

I’ve known rivers:

I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of

human blood in human veins.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.

I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.

I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.

I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln

went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy

bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

I’ve known rivers:

Ancient, dusky rivers.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

### Explain how Langston Hughes appeals to history to lend insight into the experiences of Africans in America (Source 21.8).

Langston Hughes uses a direct connection to **ancient and enduring world rivers** to root the African American experience in a history far older and more profound than slavery:

- **Ancient Heritage:** By claiming to have "known rivers ancient as the world" and connecting his soul's depth to them, Hughes instantly establishes a heritage of **timeless wisdom and spiritual depth.**
    
- **Civilizational Contribution:** He asserts that Black people were **active shapers of world history**, claiming a presence at the dawn of civilization (bathing in the **Euphrates**) and involvement in great feats of engineering (raising the **pyramids** above the **Nile**). This contradicts the racist narrative of Black inferiority.
    
- **Connecting Past to Present:** The poem ties this deep, ancient history to the African diaspora in America by referencing the **Congo** (the ancestral home) and the **Mississippi** (the site of American slavery and migration). By blending these images, Hughes gives the African American identity a sense of **powerful, enduring historical legitimacy** that fuels their resilience and pride in the present.
