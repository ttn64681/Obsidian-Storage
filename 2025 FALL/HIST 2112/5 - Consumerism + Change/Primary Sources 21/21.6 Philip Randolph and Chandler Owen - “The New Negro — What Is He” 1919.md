A. Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen founded the Messenger in 1917 to provide an outlet for African American workers. <span style="background:#fff88f">The Messenger tackled issues of both race and class from a socialist perspective.</span> It caused great controversy for its coverage of international issues, especially when it opposed U.S. involvement in World War I on pacifist grounds. **The following editorial from 1920 elaborates on the definition of the New Negro and argues for fundamental changes in the structure of American life and politics.**

- Randolph and Owen's definition of the "New Negro" is built on a foundation of total independence—politically, economically, and socially.
- This document is a crucial piece of evidence showing that the Harlem Renaissance was not just an artistic flowering but <span style="background:#fff88f">also a period of intense and radical political thought</span> that sought to completely <span style="background:#fff88f">redefine the terms of what it meant to be a Black citizen in America.</span>

### Political Independence 

The "New Negro" refuses to be a pawn of the existing political parties.

- **No More Patronage:** Unlike the "Old Negro," the "New Negro" won't sell their vote for a mere job or "political spoils".
    
- **Selective Power:** They demand not just the right to _elect_ representatives chosen by others, but the power to _select_ their own candidates, arguing that "he who selects the representatives controls the representative".
    
- **Universal Suffrage:** Their ultimate political goal is **universal suffrage**, a demand for full and equal citizenship.
    

### Economic Justice 

As workers and consumers, the "New Negro" is an active fighter for economic rights. This connects the Harlem Renaissance directly to the broader American labor movement.

- **Worker's Rights:** As a worker, their immediate goals are "more wages, shorter hours and better working conditions," and ultimately, they demand the "full product of his toil," a classic socialist principle.
    

### Uncompromising Social Equality 

This is the most radical section of the manifesto, as it directly confronts the deepest taboos of Jim Crow America.

- **"Absolute and Unequivocal Social Equality":** The "New Negro" rejects any form of qualified equality, insisting on "identity of social treatment".
    
- **Confronting the Intermarriage Taboo:** They tackle the issue of intermarriage head-on, calling it the "only logical, sound and correct aim for the Negro to entertain". They argue that accepting laws against it is the same as accepting the "stigma of inferiority".
    
- **Protecting Black Women:** Laws against intermarriage, they argue, expose Black women to sexual exploitation by white men and deny their mixed-race children the right to inherit property from their fathers. They use the statistic of **nearly four million mulattoes** in America to prove that miscegenation was already a widespread reality, but one that left Black women and their children legally vulnerable.

---
- The emergence of a **radical, self-assertive, and politically/economically conscious African American identity**, challenging the traditional, conciliatory approach to race relations and demanding fundamental, systemic changes to achieve full equality in American life.

- **Defining the "New Negro":** What is the core difference between the emerging generation of African Americans (the "New Negro") and the previous generation (the "Old Negro") in their approach to civil rights and social change?
- **Beyond Patronage to Power:** How can African Americans move past being manipulated by established political parties (Republican and Democrat) through "political spoils and patronage," to actually achieving genuine political power, representation, and universal suffrage?
- **Radical Social and Economic Transformation:** What are the necessary, uncompromising steps—particularly in economics and social relations—that must be taken to dismantle systemic racism and achieve "absolute and unequivocal 'social equality'"?
- **Challenging the Stigma of Inferiority:** How does the acceptance of discriminatory practices, such as laws against intermarriage, inherently validate the idea of Black inferiority, and why must the "New Negro" actively reject this stigma? (The authors see the acceptance of such laws as "tantamount to the acceptance of the stigma of inferiority.")
### 1. Defining the "New Negro" (Political Differences)

**Question:** What is the core difference between the emerging generation of African Americans (the "New Negro") and the previous generation (the "Old Negro") in their approach to political action?

**Answer:**

|"Old Negro" Political Approach (Implicitly Rejected)|"New Negro" Political Approach (Demanded)|
|---|---|
|Could be "lulled" by **political spoils and patronage** (accepting small favors or jobs for votes).|**Cannot be bought**; demands that his vote is not priced by a job.|
|Accepted "political promissory notes" from parties that had failed them.|**Demands political equality** and refuses to accept unfulfilled promises from either party.|
|Had the right to _elect_ representatives but not to _select_ them (meaning the parties chose the candidates).|Stands for **universal suffrage** and recognizes the necessity of **selective as well as elective representation** to ensure real control over those in power.|

### 2. Economic and Social Aims

**Question:** What are the immediate economic and uncompromising social aims of the "New Negro"?

**Answer:**

|Area|Immediate Aims|Underlying Philosophy|
|---|---|---|
|**Economic (Worker)**|**More wages, shorter hours, and better working conditions** (demanding "the full product of his toil").|As a consumer, he seeks to buy goods at the lowest price.|
|**Social**|**Absolute and unequivocal "social equality."**|Equality cannot be "qualified"; a just society must be composed of social equals who receive "identity of social treatment."|

### 3. Challenging the Stigma of Inferiority (Intermarriage)

**Question:** How does the "New Negro" view laws against intermarriage, and why do they argue that intermarriage is a "logical, sound and correct aim"?

**Answer:**

- **View on Anti-Intermarriage Laws:** The "New Negro" maintains that accepting laws against intermarriage is the same as accepting the **"stigma of inferiority."**
    
- **Reasons for Intermarriage Aim:**
    
    1. It is the **only logical, sound and correct aim** to entertain.
        
    2. Laws against intermarriage **expose Negro women to sexual exploitation** (by white men).
        
    3. They **deprive the children** resulting from these mixed-race unions (mulattoes) of the right to inherit their white father's property.
