**Explain the political and social contexts that shaped the works of New Negro writers, artists, and performers.**

**The Harlem Renaissance was shaped by a powerful mix of migration, political activism, and a defiant response to rising white supremacy. It was an era where Black artists and thinkers, concentrated in the new urban space of Harlem, forged a new identity for themselves and their community.**

## Political and Social Contexts

### The Great Migration and Urbanization 
The Harlem Renaissance would not have been possible without the **Great Migration**:

### Push Factors:
- millions of African Americans moved **from the rural South to Northern cities** to 
	- escape Jim Crow, sharecropping, and racial violence, and to find industrial jobs. 
- This mass movement created vibrant, concentrated Black communities like Harlem in New York City, which became the cultural and intellectual capital of Black America. This urban setting allowed for an unprecedented "flowering of political activism and art".

## A Spectrum of Political Thought 

The era was defined by intense political debate about the best path forward for Black Americans.
- **Black Nationalism and Separatism:** One major force was the movement led by **Marcus Garvey**, which endorsed not only Black pride but also a form of separatism.
- **Integration and Socialism:** In contrast, democratic socialists like **A. Philip Randolph** demanded "full economic, political, and social equality for the New Negro" within American society.

This clash of ideas fueled the artistic and literary explosion, as writers and thinkers explored what it meant to be Black in America.

## A Defiant Cultural Response üí™üèæ

The art of the Harlem Renaissance was a direct response to the social realities of the 1920s.
- **Confronting White Supremacy:** The movement took place against the backdrop of the "seemingly continuous rise of white supremacy," including a major resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. Poets and writers challenged this reality head-on, examining the violent history of African Americans in their work.
- **Forging the "New Negro":** A central theme was **Black pride** and an exploration of a shared African heritage. The movement's defining publication was Alain Locke's book, _The New Negro_, which captured this new spirit of self-determination and artistic expression.
- **Challenging Gender Norms:** The era was also a time for social change within the Black community itself. The introduction notes that "Black women challenged the gender conventions of both races," creating work that pushed boundaries of identity and expression. Your notes on the "Flapper" era show this was happening in the wider culture, but Black women like blues singer Ma Rainey gave it a unique voice, sometimes openly expressing queer identity in their music.

*Alain LeRoy Locke* - highly influential American philosopher, educator, writer, and patron of the arts, 
- often referred to as "Father" or "Dean" of Harlem Renaissance.

His key roles and accomplishments were:
- The Architect of the "New Negro" Concept: He edited the seminal 1925 anthology, The New Negro: An Interpretation. This **book** was the defining manifesto of the Harlem Renaissance, **showcasing the work of major Black artists and intellectuals (like Langston Hughes and Aaron Douglas) and announcing the existence of the movement to the wider world.**

- Intellectual and Visionary: Locke articulated the core philosophy of the Renaissance, arguing that **Black Americans should embrace their African heritage** (looking to African sculpture and folklore for inspiration) and create a distinct, high-quality modern art that asserted their cultural identity and spiritual emancipation.

- Distinguished Scholar: He was the first African American Rhodes Scholar (1907) and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard. He spent most of his career as a professor at Howard University, shaping a generation of Black thought.

- Patron and Critic: He actively mentored and secured financial support for young Black artists, functioning as a "philosophical midwife" who brought creative talent together and helped launch the careers of major figures.
