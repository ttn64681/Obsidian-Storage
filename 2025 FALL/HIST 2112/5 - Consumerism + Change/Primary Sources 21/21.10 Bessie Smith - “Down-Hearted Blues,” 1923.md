- Bessie Smith became one of the most popular African American performers at venues like Harlem’s Cotton Club
- Its lyrics demonstrate how Smith used music to communicate ideas about relationships, gender, and sexuality.

- The main theme of Bessie Smith’s "Down-Hearted Blues" is the **raw, complex experience of love, heartbreak, and resilience, presented through the lens of a strong, self-aware African American woman who ultimately asserts her power and demands fair treatment in relationships.**

- The song's narrator moves from a state of sorrow to one of defiant self-possession, embodying the spirit of the "New Negro" on a personal, emotional level.
- While she begins by describing the pain of unrequited love and mistreatment, she does not remain a passive victim.

- This blend of vulnerability, defiance, and self-worth made Smith an icon of the Harlem Renaissance.


## Interpret the Evidence
#### Compare _The Messenger_ (21.6) with Claude McKay's Poem (21.7)
The ideas in _The Messenger_ and Claude McKay's poem are two sides of the same coin: the intellectual framework and the emotional battle cry of the "New Negro."

- **The Messenger** provides a detailed political, economic, and social manifesto. It systematically lays out the demands of the "New Negro" for things like political independence from the major parties, economic justice for workers, and "absolute and unequivocal 'social equality'," including the right to intermarry.
- **Claude McKay's "If We Must Die"** is the raw, emotional spirit behind that blueprint. It is a visceral response to racist violence, transforming death from an act of victimization into an act of noble defiance.

### Compare the idea of the New Negro as presented by the editors of the _Messenger_ (Source 21.6) with the ideas expressed by Claude McKay (Source 21.7).

The ideas of the New Negro in these two sources are both radical and assertive but operate on different levels: **politics and immediate, physical defense.**

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mode of Action** | **Systemic Change:** Demands for electoral power, universal suffrage, and economic reform (higher wages, better conditions).                        | **Militant Self-Defense:** Demands immediate, physical resistance ("fighting back") against a "murderous, cowardly pack."                           |
| **Primary Goal**   | **Unqualified Equality:** To achieve "absolute and unequivocal 'social equality'" through political and economic pressure.                          | **Dignity in Death:** To die "nobly" and force the oppressor ("monsters") to "honor us though dead," ensuring their lives are not "shed / In vain." |
| **Main Target**    | **Political/Economic Structure:** The Republican and Democratic parties that offer only "spoils," and the economic system that exploits the worker. | **Racial Violence/Mobs:** The immediate "common foe" (mobs and persecutors) who are "Hunted and penned" African Americans "like hogs."              |
| **Tone**           | Scholarly, analytical, political, and uncompromising.                                                                                               | Fierce, defiant, passionate, and rallying.                                                                                                          |

### Explain how Langston Hughes appeals to history to lend insight into the experiences of Africans in America (Source 21.8).

Langston Hughes uses a direct connection to **ancient and enduring world rivers** to root the African American experience in a history far older and more profound than slavery:

- **Ancient Heritage:** By claiming to have "known rivers ancient as the world" and connecting his soul's depth to them, Hughes instantly establishes a heritage of **timeless wisdom and spiritual depth.**
    
- **Civilizational Contribution:** He asserts that Black people were **active shapers of world history**, claiming a presence at the dawn of civilization (bathing in the **Euphrates**) and involvement in great feats of engineering (raising the **pyramids** above the **Nile**). This contradicts the racist narrative of Black inferiority.
    
- **Connecting Past to Present:** The poem ties this deep, ancient history to the African diaspora in America by referencing the **Congo** (the ancestral home) and the **Mississippi** (the site of American slavery and migration). By blending these images, Hughes gives the African American identity a sense of **powerful, enduring historical legitimacy** that fuels their resilience and pride in the present.


### How does Aaron Douglas illustrate the themes Hughes presents in his poetry (Source 21.9)?

Aaron Douglas’s visual illustration perfectly captures the themes of **deep roots, movement, and spiritual ascent** found in Hughes’s poetry:

- **Deep Roots/Ancestry:** Douglas uses African-inspired silhouettes and geometric patterns to symbolize the enduring connection to the continent (like Hughes's **Congo** reference). The marching figures behind the central character suggest the flow of a people through history, much like the flow of the rivers.
    
- **Spiritual Depth/Enlightenment:** The central figure stands tall and faces a beam of light radiating from the **sun** in the upper left. This visually represents the same spiritual and historical depth Hughes describes when his "soul has grown deep like the rivers," symbolizing the enlightenment and hope the "New Negro" is moving toward.
    
- **A New Dawn:** The composition—rising from dark, jagged past elements toward the light—is a visual equivalent of the poem's promise of endurance, represented by the Mississippi’s "muddy bosom turn[ing] all **golden in the sunset.**"

### Why did the Harlem Renaissance flourish in the 1920s?

The Harlem Renaissance flourished in the 1920s due to a powerful confluence of social, demographic, political, and intellectual forces:

1. **The Great Migration (The Foundation):** Millions of African Americans left the rural, segregated, and economically depressed South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, including New York. **Harlem** became the most concentrated and vibrant destination for this newly urban, educated, and professional class, creating the critical mass of artists, writers, and intellectuals necessary for a cultural movement.
    
- **Post-WWI Assertiveness:** Veterans returning from World War I fueled the **"New Negro" spirit**—a cultural and political refusal to accept traditional racial submission, leading to an assertive demand for rights and dignity.
    
- **Economic Opportunity:** The commercial boom of the Roaring Twenties and the rise of the **music and publishing industries** created a viable market, allowing Black artists and musicians (like Bessie Smith) to earn a living and spread their art to a mass audience.
    
1. **Intellectual Patronage and Validation (The Catalyst):** African American intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke actively promoted the movement, urging artists to use their cultural gifts to fight racism. Locke’s anthology, **_The New Negro_**, gave the movement its name and intellectual blueprint, urging artists like Douglas (Source 21.9) to look to Africa and folk culture for inspiration.

## Put It in Context

#### Why the Harlem Renaissance Flourished in the 1920s

The Harlem Renaissance flourished in the 1920s due to a convergence of social, political, and economic factors:

- **The Great Migration:** This was the essential precondition. The mass movement of millions of African Americans from the rural South to Northern cities created a high concentration of Black people and talent in urban centers like Harlem, which became the cultural capital of Black America.
    
- **A New Assertiveness:** The "New Negro" emerged after World War I as a figure demanding full citizenship and rejecting accommodation. This new political consciousness, fueled by a range of ideologies from socialism to Black nationalism, provided the intellectual energy for the movement.
    
- **A Defiant Response to Racism:** The 1920s saw a major resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and ongoing racial violence. The Renaissance was a powerful cultural counter-movement, creating art that celebrated Black pride and confronted white supremacy.
    
- **Economic Opportunity and Patronage:** The rise of the consumer economy in the 1920s created a new market for Black art and music. The burgeoning recording industry turned performers like Bessie Smith into national stars, and a new interest from white patrons and publishers provided financial avenues for writers and artists, as seen with the success of the _Survey Graphic_ issue on Harlem.
