Through his cartoons, artist Thomas Nast crusaded against political corruption and mistreatment of freedpeople in the South. Although generally sympathetic to the rights of American Indians, in this illustration he raises questions about what the federal government should do regarding conflicts between white settlers and Indians in the West. Nast depicts Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz (left), an Indian reformer, counseling patience to western settlers.
A cartoon shows a bearded man with a top hat, glasses, and checkered suit pointing at a man who is holding his head. There are corpses on the ground, a burning building, and Native Americans riding away on horseback.
