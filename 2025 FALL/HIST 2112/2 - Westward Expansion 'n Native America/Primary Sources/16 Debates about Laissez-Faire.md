Evaluate the extent to which differing ideas of competition and cooperation influenced views about obtaining wealth in late-nineteenth-century America.

From the nation’s founding, the **pursuit of individual opportunity has held a central place among American values**. In the late nineteenth century, as big business consolidated and giant trusts came to dominate whole industries, defenders of unfettered big business argued that individual effort and initiative were still the central engine of the American economy. **Championing Adam Smith’s notion of laissez-faire — the idea that the marketplace should be left to regulate itself — they argued that government should do nothing to constrain the development of industry** (Source 16.6). Yet as poverty expanded while a small number of industrialists and financiers accumulated great wealth, reformers questioned whether individualism undermined community, and contended that the government should regulate the free market to promote the greater public welfare (Sources 16.7 and 16.9). With the gap between rich and poor growing, even industrialists realized that if they did not help the poor in some way, the working classes would rise up against them (Source 16.8). Nevertheless, they continued to resist government interference.

Defenders of the status quo argued that individualism must be preserved as the natural order of society. Critics countered that cooperation rather than individual competition made social progress possible and that the government should protect ordinary people from the harm done by greedy capitalists.
