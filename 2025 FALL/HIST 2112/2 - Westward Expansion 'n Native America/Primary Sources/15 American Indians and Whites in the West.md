Evaluate the extent to which the U.S. government from 1865 to 1890 balanced its commitment to both continental expansion and equal justice under the law and explain how Native Americans forged strategies in response to U.S. policy.

**Views on the relationship between whites and American Indians varied widely** in the late-nineteenth-century West, though most shared a basic premise — that Indian cultures and tribal identities did not deserve to be preserved and defended. **Some white Americans advocated exterminating the Indians**, whereas **others sought to assimilate them** (Sources 15.6 and 15.7). These attitudes differed significantly by region. Whites who were most likely to encounter Indians were generally the least sympathetic (Source 15.8). Government officials were also divided. The most notable differences were between civilians in the Interior Department who favored peaceful solutions and those in the War Department who were inclined to use military force to resolve conflicts. However, **even reform-minded whites often failed to understand or pay heed to actual Indian culture**, and they developed many policies that ==led to the decline of Indian tribal societies==. *Facing a dominant white American society that could see only two options — eliminating Indian culture outright, or fundamentally changing its core* — **Indian attitudes ranged from ==fierce resistance==, to accommodation to, in rare cases, assimilation** (Sources 15.9 and 15.10).
