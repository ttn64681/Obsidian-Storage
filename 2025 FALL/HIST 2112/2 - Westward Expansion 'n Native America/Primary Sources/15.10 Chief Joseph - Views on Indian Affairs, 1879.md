- **Cavanaugh (15.6):** Advocated for the extermination or forced removal of Native Americans due to a belief in their inherent savagery and as an obstacle to white expansion, reflecting a frontier-era, expansionist, and genocidal mindset.
- **Jackson (15.7):** Advocated for Native American rights and better treatment, highlighting the U.S. government's broken treaties and injustices, reflecting an Eastern reformist perspective focused on moral obligation and assimilation rather than outright destruction.

- **Nast's Illustration (15.8):** Reflects the ongoing conflict between Native Americans and the U.S. government, depicting Native Americans as victims of federal betrayal and white encroachment ("broken promises"). While sympathetic, it also implies a paternalistic view that Native Americans need to be "civilized" to resolve the conflict, representing a common reformist (but assimilationist) sentiment of the era.

- **Options for Indians:** Resistance (armed or cultural), forced relocation, assimilation, or suffering eradication.
- **Zitkala-Ša's Choice (15.9):** She was forcibly taken to a boarding school, where she endured forced assimilation (hair cutting, new clothes, language, religion) which was the intended outcome of such institutions. Though she resisted internally, the external "choice" imposed upon her was assimilation. She later used her experiences to advocate for Native American rights.
- **Why:** This choice was often made _for_ Native children by government policy, with the aim of "killing the Indian to save the man" – eradicating their culture and identity.

- **Chief Joseph's Experience (15.10):** His experience reflects the contradiction of federal policy by highlighting the government's rhetoric of peace and justice vs. its actions of broken treaties, forced removal, and violence. He speaks of "talk and talk, but nothing is done," "broken promises," and the desire for "equal rights" for all men, directly contrasting the stated ideals with the reality of dispossession and mistreatment. The government claimed to seek peace but consistently acted to seize land and suppress Native sovereignty.

In 1877, following a string of treaties broken by the U.S. government, Chief Joseph led the Nez Percé on a 1,300-mile march from their tribal land in Oregon to Canada, in search of a home. Thirty miles from the Canadian border, they were surrounded by U.S. troops. After his capture, Chief Joseph was taken to Washington, D.C., where he addressed a gathering of cabinet members and congressmen and tried to convince them to return tribal lands to the Nez Percé.

At last I was granted permission to come to Washington and bring my friend Yellow Bull and our interpreter with me. I am glad we came. I have shaken hands with a great many friends, but there are some things I want to know which no one seems able to explain. I can not understand how the Government sends a man out to fight us, as it did General [Nelson A.] Miles, and then breaks his word. Such a government has something wrong about it. I can not understand why so many chiefs are allowed to talk so many different ways, and promise so many different things.… I do not understand why nothing is done for my people. I have heard talk and talk, but nothing is done. Good words do not last long unless they amount to something. Words do not pay for my dead people. They do not pay for my country, now overrun by white men. They do not protect my father’s grave. They do not pay for all my horses and cattle. Good words will not give me back my children.… Good words will not give my people good health and stop them from dying. Good words will not get my people a home where they can live in peace and take care of themselves. I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken promises.… Too many misrepresentations have been made, too many misunderstandings have come up between the white men about the Indians. If the white man wants to live in peace with the Indian he can live in peace. There need be no trouble. Treat all men alike. Give them all the same law. Give them all an even chance to live and grow. All men were made by the same Great Spirit Chief. They are all brothers. The earth is the mother of all people, and all people should have equal rights upon it. You might as well expect the rivers to run backward as that any man who was born a free man should be contented when penned up and denied liberty to go where he pleases. If you tie a horse to a stake, do you expect he will grow fat? If you pen an Indian up on a small spot of earth, and compel him to stay there, he will not be contented, nor will he grow and prosper.…

I know that my race must change. We can not hold our own with the white men as we are. We only ask an even chance to live as other men live. We ask to be recognized as men. We ask that the same law shall work alike on all men. If the Indian breaks the law, punish him by the law. If the white man breaks the law, punish him also.

Whenever the white man treats the Indian as they treat each other, then we shall have no more wars.… For this time the Indian race are waiting and praying. I hope that no more groans of wounded men and women will ever go to the ear of the Great Spirit Chief above, and that all people may be one people.

Interpret the Evidence


Explain why James Michael Cavanaugh (Source 15.6) and Helen Hunt Jackson (Source 15.7) reach different conclusions concerning Indian policy.
    How does Thomas Nast’s illustration (Source 15.8) reflect the historical situation in 1878?
    What options did Indians have when confronted with white determination to eradicate their culture? What choice does Zitkala-Ša (Source 15.9) make? Why?
    How does Chief Joseph’s experience (Source 15.10) reflect the fundamental contradiction of federal policy toward Indians?
    Explain which audience would have been most likely to respond positively to each document’s argument.

*   **Cavanaugh (15.6):** White settlers on the frontier, proponents of Manifest Destiny, those who feared Native Americans, or individuals seeking rapid access to Native lands.
*   **Jackson (15.7):** Eastern reformers, humanitarian groups, religious organizations, and some sympathetic politicians concerned with moral justice and the government's honor.
*   **Nast (15.8):** A general Northern audience sympathetic to the plight of Native Americans as victims, but who might also believe in their ultimate "civilization" or assimilation.
*   **Zitkala-Ša (15.9):** Native American communities who experienced similar cultural trauma, as well as non-Native reformers and humanitarian groups who might be educated about the abuses of boarding schools.
*   **Chief Joseph (15.10):** Reformers, humanitarians, and potentially some members of Congress or the public who could be swayed by his eloquent appeals for justice, equality, and peace, and his critique of broken promises.


Put It in Context

Imagine that you are an American president in the second half of the nineteenth century and can design Indian policy. Based on what you have read, what would you do, and why? What challenges might you face as you attempted to implement your policy?

advocate for policies based on **true equality, respecting treaty obligations, and supporting Native sovereignty and self-determination.** This would involve:

- **Honoring Treaties:** Ceasing all land seizures and enforcing existing treaties.
- **Equal Law:** Implementing Chief Joseph's call for "the same law" for all, punishing white transgressors as well as Native ones.
- **Economic Support:** Providing resources for Native communities to develop self-sufficient economies on their land, rather than forcing assimilation or relocation.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Ending forced assimilation policies like boarding schools (Zitkala-Ša) and supporting Native cultural practices.
