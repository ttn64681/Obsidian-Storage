## Safety Concerns
- no safety measures / regulations for child laborers
- **35k people will die a year due to industrial accidents**
#### Child Laborers
- Children have to rig their own safety equipment
- Used in textile mills b/c of small hands can recah inside machines easier

## Working Conditions in U.S. Factories
### Sanitation
- **HORRIBLE**
- **horrible food**
	- chemicals added to make it appear "fresh"
	- milk watered down to make them last longer
	- added purated calf brains to make it frothy
	- added chalk dust + other chemicals to make it look white & fresh
### Working hours
- **LONG** 10-16 hrs / day
	- 16 hrs a double shift ðŸ˜­
- 6 days a week, only Sunday off
### Work style
- **repetitive**
- *extremely regimented*, on-the-clock
	- punished for being late
###  "Deskilling" of labor
- Before industrialism:
	- people who made stuff (like furniture) were trained artisans
- After industrialism:
	- Machines take-over -> **Deskilling of labor**
	- **artisans hate this!**
	- Created alienation from the product-making process
	- not enjoyable

### Wages
- **LOW**
- Benefits don't exist at this time
- BETTER IN Europe
### Taylorism
- Taylorist specialists - 
	- figures out how to make labor more efficient and faster
	- comes up with detailed plans with how humans should move their bodies to facilitate faster production
	- Turns people into machines

# Unionization and Strikes - Workers Resist Industrial Conditions
## 1877 -- Great Railroad Strike
- Baltimore-Ohio Railroad Companies enforce a Paycut:
	- **Sudden Paycut of 20%** on laborers within Factories ->
	- Laborers *walk off the job.*
- Labor rallies:
	- Hold protests and parades in Baltimore
	- **Railroad Production Comes to a halt...**
- Government is Pro-Industry:
	- 6th Maryland Regiment:
		- **Maryland National Guards are deployed** by govt to "quell riots and confront striking workers"
		- beat up mfs everywhere right and left
		- bricks are flying, bullets are shot, civilians killed
- **Strikers lose -> Go back to work...**
- Laborers are unsatisfied, leading to **National Labor Union**

# 1870s-1880s - Knights of Labor
- After Laborers lose in Great Railroad Strike, they form **National Labor Union**
- 15 Local Chapters
- 10% of Laborers are part of Knights of Labor
- **Women could join** and rise to positions of power
- **African Americans** could join but were segregated in their own organizations
- *They DON'T allow Chinese people*

- Paper Hat 
	- symbolizes factory worker
- Red
	- the color of labor

### Radical Goals
- **They organize Strikes to:**
	- *get wages higher*
	- *slow the machines down*
	- *make working conditions safer*
	- *not have child labor*

### The Eight Hour Movement, 1886
- **8 hours for work,**
- **8 hours for rest,**
- **8 hours for what we will**
*-> Created the standard for today of 8-hr shifts*

- Are no longer today
- **1886:**
	- huge parade in Chicago shouting for 8 hrs / day
		- 80k people
		- however, at the same time, a strike was going on in Chicago
		- Altercation b/w strikers and policemen
		- policemen killed couple strikers
	- Strikers decide they should come together again to rally against police brutality
	- **Harmarket Riot:**

		- Police open-fire
		- People die
#### Haymarket Riot aftermath:
- **government captured 7 people from Knights of Labor:**
- put on trial
- 1 suicide, 2 acquitted, 4 hung
- **STRIKES FEAR AMONG LABORERS**
- *Reputation of Violent Terrorists applied to Knights of Labors*
- **-> END OF KNIGHTS OF LABOR**

# Labor Union Successor: American Federation of Labor (AFL)
- **succeeded the Knights of Labor, but take the middle ground:**
	- make more concessions, more negotations, more talking
	- Knights of Labor more adversarial
- **more "respectable"**

# More Radical Unions - often repressed by authorities
## United Mine Workers of America - Ludlow Massacre, 1914
- RED COLOR OF LABOR
- Very angry People
- **Coal Miners were ESPECIALLY exploited and abused, so were the most radical laborers of America**
- *fought for better working conditions, wages, and rights for coal miners,*
	- **often through militant means**

- Goons and Ginks -
	- nicknames for national guards and private security that would beat laborers up for striking or whatever

## Industrial Workers of the World - very radical:
- **Socialists, Communists, Anarchists, etc.**
- Broader in scope
- **direct action and strikes**

# 1892 -- Homestead Steel Strike: Andrew Carnegie fights back
- Conflict-ridden period

## Themes to Understand:
- Democracy and Individualism is thrown away in a factory
- you are isolated and treated as a cog in a machine
	- low wages, poor working conditions, dehumanized
- Labor Unions form to fight back for their democracy and american individualism within factories!!!

#### Reformers and Revolutionaries
- Reformers:
	- System is not wrong, but we need to reform it so it works for everybody
	- Vast majority of America falls in that camp
- Revolutionaries:
	- System is too rotten and corrupt, irreparable -> we must burn it all down
	- You find these people in Coal Mines, workplaces where people are abused and angry
	- Coal Miners are severely abused and exploited laborers
		- Coal Companies - authoritarian organizations
		- Coal Miners must live on work premises
		- if you complained, you were fired
		- had to buy food and clothes from the company-store
		- didn't pay in money, paid in SCRIP
			- SCRIP could only be paid in company-store
