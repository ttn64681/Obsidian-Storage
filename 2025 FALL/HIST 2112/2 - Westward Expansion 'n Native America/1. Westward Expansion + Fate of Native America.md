# Westward Movement

**Some people didn't like slavery... but not for moral reasons**
- "West should be a region of **small farms**"
	- *Can't have this if there a bunch of plantations*

## Homestead Act
- government's effort to distribute land in West to farmers for dirt cheap
- **Townships:** square plots of land for state
	- **Sections:** Townships are divided into smaller squares
		- ==**Quarter Section**: *160 acres parcels of land per family*==

## Railroads
- **Gave land to Railroad companies also!!!**
	- *Would pay Railroad corps in land instead of money*
	- Railroad companies became real estate companies when world start selling land they acquired

## Railroad Opportunities
- **Business Opportunities**
	- buy land, flip it, and resell for profit
	- Cattle ranching - cowboys
	- Tension b/w cattle ranchers and farmers over grazing and trampling over land

## Cowboys Convert from Corporate
- a lot of cowboys were working men (employee of a corporation)
- a lot of cowboys would often strike for better conditions
- A lot of former cowboys get laid off and become small ranchers
- Wyoming Stock Growers retaliate since they don't like that the people they lay off and stealing "their" cattle:
	- ASSASSINATION ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
	- Army got invovled

## Manifest Destiny
- **Many Americans believed that it was their destiny to spread from East to West**
	- "Columbia" Painting - leading Americans from East to West
		- Symbol of Union
		- Statue of Liberty
		- Holding a telegraph line

## Prospect for AA's
- **Homestead Act was open for Black People too!!!!**
- *A path to go if you escape debt from sharecropping...*

## Eradication School
- #### **Eradicationists** - " A good Indian is a dead Indian "
- #### **Myth of the "Vanishing Indian"**

		- based on middle-class values
		- *Goal: "Kill the Indian, but Save the Man"*

		- *Boarding School*
			- only speak english
			- cut hair
			- be Christian
			- go to school w/ other tribes
	
			- Men: make shoes, become cobblers
			- Women: sew clothings/fabrics
	- **Adults:**
		- #### **Homestead Act** - get parcels of land
		- Learn to be farmers!
		- #### **Loss of 'Excess Land':**
			- *Their reserved land was sold due to Homestead Act* (half of remaining reserved land)
		- #### **Lack of Compatibility w/ Native Lifestyles:**
