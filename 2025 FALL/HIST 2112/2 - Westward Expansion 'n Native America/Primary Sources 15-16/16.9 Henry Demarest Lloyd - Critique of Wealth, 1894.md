*   **William Graham Sumner (16.6):** Likely held a Social Darwinist view, arguing against significant responsibility for the wealthy to directly help the poor, believing that such aid interfered with natural economic selection and individual responsibility, where success and poverty were outcomes of individual merit or lack thereof.
*   **Andrew Carnegie (16.8):** Believed the wealthy had a moral obligation to act as "trustees" of their fortunes, responsibly distributing their surplus wealth through strategic philanthropy (e.g., funding libraries, universities) that provided opportunities for self-improvement, rather than through indiscriminate charity that might foster idleness.

-   **Support for Federal Intervention (based on 16.9 and historical context):**
    *   **Concentration of Wealth & Monopolies (16.9):** Lloyd directly describes "one-man power," "control without consent," and pervasive "monopoly" in all sectors, leading to the exploitation of the public and workers, which would support Bellamy's argument for a nationalized system to manage these powerful entities for collective good.
    *   **Political Corruption (16.9):** Lloyd notes "government but a fountain of franchises" and "corruption in office," demonstrating how private business influenced government at the expense of the public, suggesting a need for federal oversight.
    *   **Labor Unrest & Inequality:** Widespread strikes, poor working conditions, and vast wealth disparities of the era illustrated the failure of unregulated capitalism to provide equitable outcomes.
*   **Refute Federal Intervention (based on general historical context, Sumner/Carnegie):**
    *   **Laissez-faire Economics:** Arguments that the free market, unhindered by government, would naturally regulate itself, promoting innovation and economic growth.
    *   **"Captains of Industry" narrative:** Belief that industrialists were benevolent creators of jobs and wealth, deserving of their fortunes, and that their private enterprise was more efficient than government.
    *   **Fear of Socialism:** Concerns that federal intervention or nationalization (as Bellamy suggested) would stifle individual initiative, lead to government inefficiency, and move the country towards undesirable socialist or communist systems.

According to Lloyd, wealthy Americans maintain power at the expense of everyone else by:
<span style="background:#fff88f">*   Creating **monopolies** (in land, transportation, trade, and politics) out of self-interest, ending competition through "combination" and "steady consolidation" leading to "one-man power."</span>
*   Exercising "power without control, exercised through forms which make it secret, anonymous, and perpetual."
*   Viewing resources (science, government, nations) as solely for their **syndicates, franchises, and customers.**
*   Allowing "power to steal from the many to the few," breeding "Pharaohs in counting-rooms" who rule without consent or representation.




Many academics and writers attacked industrial capitalists, claiming that *their excessive wealth came at the expense of workers and the general public*. Lawyer and journalist Henry Demarest Lloyd wrote numerous articles for the Chicago Tribune exposing corruption in business and politics. A reformer influenced by British socialists, **Lloyd supported legislation to ban child labor and to allow women to vote**. In his 1894 book Wealth against Commonwealth, he denounced ruthless and unsavory competitive practices by industrialists who created monopolies that exploited working people. In the following excerpt, **Lloyd raises questions about the fundamental value of industrial capitalism and its threat to social progress**.


- Henry Demarest Lloyd criticizes industrial capitalism, arguing that the excessive wealth of "money-makers" leads to "one-man power" and "control without consent." He <span style="background:#fff88f">asserts that unchecked self-interest inevitably results in monopolies</span>—in land, transportation, trade, and politics—which exploit workers and corrupt society. Lloyd compares the era to an "over-ripe" Rome, seeing the conflict with monopolistic business as the new "irrepressible conflict," much like slavery, where power is "stealing from the many to the few."


If our civilization is destroyed, … it will not be by … barbarians from below. Our barbarians come from above. Our great money-makers have sprung in one generation into seats of power kings do not know. The forces and the wealth are new, and have been the opportunity of new men. Without restraints of culture, experience, the pride, or even the inherited caution of class or rank, these men, intoxicated, think they are the wave instead of the float, and that they have created the business which has created them. To them science is but a never-ending repertoire of investments stored up by nature for the syndicates, government but a fountain of franchises, the nations but customers in squads, and a million the unit of a new arithmetic of wealth written for them. They claim a power without control, exercised through forms which make it secret, anonymous, and perpetual….

… In casting about for the cause of our industrial evils, public opinion has successively found it in “competition,” “combination,” the “corporations,” “conspiracies,” “trusts.” But competition has ended in combination, and our new wealth takes as it chooses the form of corporation or trust, or corporation again, and with every change grows greater and worse. Under these kaleidoscopic masks we begin at last to see progressing to its terminus a steady consolidation, the end of which is one-man power. The conspiracy ends in one, and one cannot conspire with himself. When this solidification of many into one has been reached, we shall be at last face to face with the naked truth that it is not only the form but the fact of arbitrary power, of control without consent, of rule without representation that concerns us.

Business motivated by the self-interest of the individual runs into monopoly at every point it touches the social life—land monopoly, transportation monopoly, trade monopoly, political monopoly in all its forms, from contraction of the currency to corruption in office. The society in which in half a lifetime a man without a penny can become a hundred times a millionaire is as over-ripe, industrially, as was, politically, the Rome in which the most popular bully could lift himself from the ranks of the legion on to the throne of the Caesars. Our rising issue is with business. Monopoly is business at the end of its journey. It has got there. The irrepressible conflict is now as distinctly with business as the issue so lately met was with slavery. Slavery went first only because it was the cruder form of business….

Our system, so fair in its theory and so fertile in its happiness and prosperity in its first century, is now, following the fate of systems, becoming artificial, technical, corrupt; and, as always happens in human institutions, after noon, power is stealing from the many to the few. Believing wealth to be good, the people believed the wealthy to be good. But, again in history, power has intoxicated and hardened its possessors, and Pharaohs are bred in counting-rooms as they were in palaces. Their furniture must be banished to the world-garret [attic], where lie the out-worn trappings of the guilds and slavery and other old lumber of human institutions.

Interpret the Evidence

Compare the attitudes of William Graham Sumner (Source 16.6) and Andrew Carnegie (Source 16.8) toward whether the wealthy have a responsibility to help the poor.
    What historical evidence would support or refute the argument for federal intervention against big business found in Edward Bellamy’s novel, Looking Backward (Source 16.7)?
    How do wealthy Americans maintain their power at the expense of everyone else, according to Henry Demarest Lloyd (Source 16.9)?
    What changes in U.S. society and government might Sumner, Carnegie, Bellamy, and Lloyd recommend for individuals to achieve success?

Put It in Context

Despite their different philosophies, what do these men think about the growth of organizations during the late nineteenth century?


Despite their differing philosophies, these men generally acknowledged the increasing power and efficiency of large-scale organizations (corporations, trusts, and even a nationalized industrial system) during the late nineteenth century.

*   **Sumner and Carnegie** viewed the growth of large private organizations positively, seeing them as natural outcomes of economic competition and engines of progress, respectively.
*   **Bellamy** critiqued private capitalist organizations but believed their large-scale efficiency pointed toward an inevitable and desirable future of a single, nationalized, state-run industrial organization for the common good.
*   **Lloyd** was highly critical of the unchecked growth of private monopolies and trusts, seeing them as corrupt, undemocratic, and exploitative, necessitating federal intervention and regulation.

Their agreement lay in recognizing the profound impact and scale of these new organizational forms; their disagreement was over who should control them and for whose benefit.
