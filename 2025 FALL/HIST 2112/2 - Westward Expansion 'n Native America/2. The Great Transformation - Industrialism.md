## The Bad of Industrialism
### Environmental Changes
- Oil + Oil Rigs:
	- air and water pollution, habitat destruction, fossil fuels and gas operations
- Forests consumed by Industrialism was unbelievable

### Social + Cultural Changes - Laborers
- Child laborers in coal mines
	- "Black Lung"
- Women - "Mill Girls"
	- Behaviors we're heavily policed
		- curfews, dorms for them to stay in to continue working
- Men
	- Dangerous, laborious working conditions
### Raising Important Questions
- Questions regarding:
	- What does Democracy Look Like in a Factory???
	- Industrialism questioning the American Dream:
		- from Agrarian Independence to Wage Dependency
		- Challenged the "Dignity of Labor"

## Snapshot: America at Midcentury
- Soon Surpassed Great Britain...
- Agrarian Farms STILL present EVERYWHERE and DOMINATING!!!

## Industrialism in Earnest
- Massive growth due to:
Railroads ->
Resources:
	- Steel (for machines and inventions)
	- Coal (to run train)
Communications - managing railroad systems for transportation
Business Innovations
	- Vertical and Horizontal Integration
	- Terry College
	- Andrew Carnegie
Government
	- **Republican Party - Big Government**
		- Origins: Anti-Slavery
		- *Instead of Plantations, we want Small Farmers, Industries, and Banks*
		- Therefore, **government is Corporate Friendly**
		- *Presidents we're not so much vigorous leaders, but instead "managers":*
			- "Bland personality"
		- Supporting: Resource, Business, Technology, Innovation Support
		- #### **Drawbacks of Industry Support:** They did not gaf about strikes and the workers
			- *would get the army to beat workers up for not working*
			- *Lax taxes*


## New South
- Slavery is over
- Future is industry and finance
- We must encourage investments from outside
- Everything will change except for our white relations(?)

### Industrialism and white supremacy
### The South as raw materials
### The continuing dominance of cotton

## Transformations
### The Rise of Middle Class
- Social change brings about Cultural change ->
- Birth of the Middle Class
	- Clubs:
		- This is an era of "clubs." Americans love organizations
		- Shriners - meet regularly, charity work, mainly socialization
		- Benefits, insurances...
		- **Clubs segregated by:**
			- race
			- gender
		- Sports interest!!!!!
			- Development of sports beginning!!!
			- fighting/boxing
			- dog fighting
		- Illegal Betting
- Biking
- Golf

#### "A Man's World"
- Politics for men
- Clubs were important for women for political power:
	- e.g. Women's "Garden Club" engaging in politics, despite not being able to vote

#### The African-American Middle Class
- barriers everywhere:
	- Pink Morton - "Morton Theater"
		- black person who lived in a strictly "rich white" neighborhood/street
	- Biking

<hr>
### Repeating Questions About Democracy:
- what does it mean to be American in a coal mine?
	- arguments over what rights you get in a factory?
		- lots of violence
		- gets ugly
