# How Reconstruction Failed
- North Failure

## 1.
- 1880 twilight zone between reconstruction and
- African Americans would have rights in 1870s and have to fight for them AGAIN in 1960s!!!

## Ida B Wells
- Child of segregation and reconstruction
- Ida B Wells tried to sit in white train, dragged out, went to court, and lost… :(

- African Americans get taste of freedom:
	- acquired land, built schools

## Henry Grady
- documents the "New South" (post civil war)
- tried to sell vision of south, economic growth, more modern, and not as much Reconstruction conflict
- Ignored the reality that black people faced

## "New South" looked like Old South
### Sharecropping :
- people became increasingly in debt b/c of interest, yearly contracts
- AA's couldn't always read so would unknowingly sign their independence away
- Labor System took force later ->**Convict Leasing**:
	- Pipeline from Prison to Profits
	- Inhumane and barbaric form of punishment
	- In effect, a form of slavery
	- Black women subject to sexual abuse and assault

## Move West : 1st AA Large Migration
- 1879: Exo-dusters left for Kansas
- leaving racism and sharecropping
- identified w/ Bible of Exodus
- Lot of black leaderships didn't want people to leave to Kansas - We need to stay and fight!!!
	- Black Eliot - Black congressman
	- Some people didn't listen
- When they arrived in Kansas, nothing really changed, didn't find land
- **Couldn't out-run Jim Crow**

## Racism Persists
- still racism in private locations like restaurants, theaters, etc.
- **Color Line Created:** resulted in Black People creating a Black World in a White World
- They had their own businesses and churches, etc.
- This continues to the 20th century

## Going Against Jim Crow
- black alliances w/ whites based on economic mutual interests
- **Colored farmers' alliances:**
	- *represents a seeking of political power by black people*
- **Organizing people based on class lines versus racial lines**
- Grassroots mvt by normal people
- **People's Party - the Populist**
- *Government* created propaganda and incited racism within poor white people and whatever means *to crush the People's Party*

## Isaiah Montgomery
- **American community leader, politician, and the founder of Mound Bayou, Mississippi**, an all-black community
- Constitution stripped any political power to black people
	- Deprives black men right to vote
	- Literacy Tests
	- Poll Taxes
- Tells Black People that we have to settle. Sucks up to White People.
	- Black people felt he betrayed their community

## Return of Rampant/Legalized Racism :sob:
- Scientific racism
	- white people should be with white people and otherwise is unnatural
	- Tried to prove a social argument
- White Southerners:
	- **legal lynching**
		- wasn't klan, wasn't extremists, it was the farmers, clergies, laypeople
	- they were judge, jury, and executioner
- Impose white supremacy in the South
	- God-given right


## Exposing White Crimes
- News negatively portrayed black people
## Fighting Back - Ida B Wells
- journalist fighting for black people
- 1889 - becomes ⅓ of free speech
- **Lynching of white men -> Ida investigates this :**
	- White people say lynching is for white women's protection
	- Ida reveals its to take away from accomplished black people
- Ida chased out of Memphis, but continues to write
- **Chicago World's Fair -> Ida seizes platform opportunity**
	- "The White City"
	- Fair to prove that they had surpassed EU
	- Was supposed to prove that US was unified!
		- Clearly, African Americans were not included
	- Africans were imported
	- Eskimos imported
	- Frederick Douglas wanted to show that AA's had progressed from slavery
	- Fair refused to give Black People an exhibit in fair
	- Ida B Wells and Frederick Douglas fights back : =>
		- Fought back!!!!
