The following cartoon appeared in the satirical magazine Judge the year <font color="#ffff00">after Congress renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act</font> and <font color="#ffff00">added provisions requiring the Chinese already living in the United States to carry certificates of identity and residence</font>. A caption beneath the cartoon states: “Judge (to Miss Columbia) — ‘You allowed that boy to come into your school, it would be inhuman to throw him out now — it will be sufficient in the future to keep his brothers out!’ ” While the cartoon favors the Chinese Exclusion Act, it presents a more complex message. It accepts the presence of other immigrant groups and Native Americans, shown in stereotyped depictions, suggesting that schooling will turn them into true Americans. It also expresses some sympathy for the Chinese remaining in the country. The cartoon also proposes that some of these earlier immigrants harbored anti-Chinese feelings. Note the Irish American holding up a blackboard that says, “Kick Out the Heathen; He’s Got No Vote.”

A cartoon shows a classroom with a sign on the wall that reads, “Miss Columbia’s School.” A woman ushers a small Chinese man through the exit while men of other ethnicities watch happily. One of the men holds a sign that reads, “Kick out the heathen he’s got no vote.”
