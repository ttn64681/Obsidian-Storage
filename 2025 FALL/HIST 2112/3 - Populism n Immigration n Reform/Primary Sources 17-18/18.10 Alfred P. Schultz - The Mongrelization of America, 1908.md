Using the *fall of Rome* as his example, **Alfred P. Schultz** argued in *Race or Mongrel (1908)* **that the mixing of races produced a mongrel civilization** and **inevitably led to the decay of a nation**. As one reviewer noted at the time, the author’s “apparent object is to check alien immigration into the United States.” Like most opponents of the new immigrants, Schultz used arguments based on moral judgments and supposedly sound medical and scientific information.

The influx of these races cannot be without consequences. The surgeons at the ports of immigration observe that **the present immigrants have a much higher percent of loathsome diseases**, and that, in general physique, **it is very much inferior to the immigration of thirty years ago**. The history of the races now coming proves beyond doubt their mental inferiority to the races that immigrated before the advent of Slavs and Latins. If immigration is still a blessing, then the sturdy *Northern races are in every way preferable to the Southern and Southeastern debris of races that have been*. The free admission of these latter prevents the coming of the former, for if content to compete with Slavs and Latins, the Northerners need not migrate as far as the United States. Much more important than the economic effects of immigration are the racial effects of immigration….

Up to the middle of the last century a distinct national character was developing in the United States, and certain distinctive traits were forming. The addition of millions of other races has caused a decomposition which prevented the endurance of these characteristics, and caused this development to cease….

One cause only is sufficiently powerful to cause the decay of a nation. This cause is promiscuousness. A nation is decayed that consists of degenerates, and it consists of degenerates when it no longer constitutes a distinct race. A degenerated race is one that has no longer the same internal worth which it had of old, for the reason that incessant infusions of foreign blood have diluted and weakened the old blood. In other words, a nation is deteriorated that consists of individuals not at all related or very distantly related to the founders of the nation….

**The principle that all men are created equal is still considered the chief pillar of strength of the United States. It is a little declamatory phrase, and only one objection can be raised against it, that it does not contain one iota of truth**. <font color="#ffff00">Every man knows that the phrase is a falsehood.</font> <span style="background:#fff88f">The truth is that all men are created unequa</span>l. Even the men of one and the same race are unequal; the inequalities, however, are not greater than the inequalities existing between the individual leaves of one tree, for they are variations of one and the same type. The differences between individuals of distinct races are essential, and, as they are differences that exist between one species and another, they are lasting. The attempts at creating perfect man, man pure and simple, or “The American,” by a fusion of all human beings, is similar to the attempt of creating the perfect dog by a fusion of all canine races. Every animal breeder knows that it cannot be done….

The United States is not much less cosmopolitan today than imperial Rome was. The friends of universal uniformity and of eternal peace will say: “Well, as soon as we are equally worthless, we will not know it, and happiness and peace will prevail.” The conclusion is false. The mongrels are equally worthless, but there is no harmony in the depraved lot. The instincts of the different races do not entirely disappear, but they cannot develop. The result is internal unhappiness as far as the individual is concerned, and discord, chronic civil war, as far as the state is concerned. Anarchy within the individual, anarchy in the state.

And why should promiscuousness in the United States have a different effect than it had in Rome and elsewhere? The opinion is advanced that the public schools change the children of all races into Americans. Put a Scandinavian, a German, and a Magyar boy in at one end, and they will come out Americans at the other end. Which is like saying, let a pointer, a setter, and a pug enter one end of a tunnel and they will come out three greyhounds at the other end.

Public schools are in our time not educational institutions, but information bureaus, and the cultivation of the memory predominates. The children of every race can be trained to the cultivation of memory, but they cannot all be educated alike. The instincts of the different races are too much out of harmony. It is for this reason that the schools give information, with very little education. Schools cannot accomplish the impossible. To express the same opinion biologically, “All animals cannot be fed with the same fodder.” …

This is the truth: schools, political institutions, and environment are utterly incapable to produce anything. No man can ever become anything else than he is already potentially and essentially. Education and schools are favourable or detrimental to development. They cannot create. To express it differently, no man can ever learn anything or know anything that he does not know already potentially and essentially…. Biologically expressed, this sentence reads as follows: A young pug develops into nothing but an old pug, a young greyhound into nothing but an old greyhound; and never, in all the ages between the creation of the world and doomsday, does a pug develop into a greyhound, no matter what the education, the training, the political institutions, and the environment.

Put It in Context

What are the limitations of the melting pot metaphor for immigrant assimilation?

What metaphor would you choose to describe the assimilation process? Explain your choice



- Israel Zangwill, through his character David in *The Melting-Pot*, believes immigrants will become "real Americans" because America is "God’s Crucible," a divine "Melting-Pot" where the "fires of God" will fuse all "races of Europe," their fifty languages, histories, and "blood hatreds" into a new, unified "American"—a "coming superman." He sees this as a process of complete transformation and fusion.

- Both cartoons utilize a "melting pot" or assimilation metaphor, but with different exclusions. Source 18.7, "The Mortar of Assimilation," depicts most European nationalities blending under Miss Columbia's stirring, but singles out the **Irish** as "the one element that won't mix." Source 18.8, "Be Just — Even to John **Chinaman,**" similarly shows other groups, and even Native Americans, in Miss Columbia's school (implying assimilation), but explicitly advocates for "kicking out the heathen" (Chinese immigrants), showing them being expelled while other groups approve. **Both cartoons endorse the idea of assimilation for some groups but highlight specific, often racialized or religiously prejudiced, exceptions they deem unassimilable or undesirable.**

    Alfred Schultz vehemently rejects the melting pot and assimilation, arguing that racial differences are fundamental and immutable ("all men are created unequal"). He believes "incessant infusions of foreign blood" from "inferior" races lead to national "decay" and "mongrelization." He would view the melting pot as a destructive force that creates a "depraved lot" of "equally worthless" individuals, leading to "anarchy."

    Schultz would likely evaluate both cartoons negatively, not because they exclude some groups, but because they even *attempt* to show assimilation for *any* distinct "races." He would dismiss the notion that Germans, French, African Americans (18.7), or even Irish (implicitly in 18.8, despite their resistance in 18.7) could truly "mix" or become "American" in his racial sense. He would likely agree with the *exclusionary* sentiment towards the "unmixable" (Irish in 18.7) or "Chinaman" (18.8), but he would extend that rejection of assimilation to nearly all immigrant groups, particularly the "Southern and Southeastern debris of races."


    William Birney's view (Source 18.9) is fundamentally opposite to Schultz's (Source 18.10). Birney champions **religious freedom and tolerance**, arguing against the deportation of "Mohammedan" immigrants based on their religion. He believes that if allowed to settle peacefully, they would assimilate and become "peaceful and excellent citizens." He sees discrimination as un-American and potentially dangerous.

    Schultz, by contrast, advocates **extreme racial prejudice and exclusion**. He rejects the idea of religious freedom (or any form of equality) as a "falsehood," and instead bases his arguments on supposed racial inferiority and the danger of "mongrelization" from *all* "inferior" immigrant races, not just religious groups. Schultz would see Birney's call for tolerance as naive and destructive to the racial purity of the nation.


    The melting pot metaphor, as seen across these sources, has several limitations:
    *   **Oversimplification of Identity:** It assumes a complete erasure of old identities in favor of a new, undifferentiated "American" identity, neglecting the persistent cultural, religious, and ethnic ties immigrants often maintain.
    *   **Ignores Selectivity:** It doesn't account for the "vegetable soup" reality where immigrants often selectively adopt American customs while preserving their heritage.
    *   **Disregards Nativism and Discrimination:** It overlooks the fact that many native-born Americans, like Schultz, actively rejected the assimilation of certain groups, or that institutions discriminated against them, preventing full "melting."
    *   **Assumes a Homogenous "Melted" Product:** It implies a single, ideal "American" identity to which all must conform, ignoring the possibility of a multicultural society.
    *   **Excludes Non-White Groups:** Historically, the "melting pot" was often implicitly (or explicitly, as in the cartoons) applied primarily to European immigrants, while non-white groups (e.g., Chinese, as per 18.8) were often deemed unassimilable.
