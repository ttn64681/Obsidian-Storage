Farmers Found Political Party: (in response to Industrialism)
- **Populist Party**
## Intro; "The Rectangle of Righteousness"

## "Agrarian America"
1) **"Jeffersonian agrarianism"** - farmers as ideal citizens
	- **people who till the soil are the most virtuous citizens**
	- "Farmers are the ideal members/candidates of a democracy"
		- they are independent
	- *Industry is a recipe for Decline of Democracy, b/c...*
		- Industrialism doesn't give people individual freedom
		- *employees get fired if they don't vote for owner's desired candidate*

## Industrialism's Threats to Farmers
### Industrialists are the New "Heroes"...
- Industrialists are looked up as the center of attention
1) **"Status Anxiety"**
	- Farmers are no longer seen as important
2) **The threat to community and family values**
	- Industrialism is corrosive b/c makes people:
		- only care about money
		- only care about competition
		- only care about people's value w/in business
3) **Financial trouble, debt, etc.**
	- Farmers have problems with debt too
		- Overproduction - too good at their jobs!
		- Price -> drops
		- Farmers can barely make a living
		- Costs of Making does not yield Good Reward
			- Farmers then try to produce more volume to make up for low price
			- Cycle repeats -> price drops even more
4) **Monopolies - Railroads and banks**
	- Farmers in debt want loans from banks
	- Banks don't trust Farmers and give loans w/ high interest
	- Farmers are puzzled and outraged ->
		- "We are American Heroes! Why are you doing this?!?"
	1) **"Producerism" : the true source of wealth**
		- John Locke "Labor Theory of Value"
			- *Value is Created by Labor*
			- *Wealth is Created by Physical Labor*
		- *Farmer is literally Physical Labor!!! We feed you all!!!*

## Forming "Alliances"
- ***Farmers are the only one speaking up for problems with democracy:***
	- *usurpation, bribery, extortion, depression*
1) 1867-70
	- Patrons of Husbandry, aka "The Grange"
2) ***1880s - National Farmers' Alliance***
	*a. "Colored Alliances"*
	b. Links to the Knights of Labor (1st ever Anti-Industrial Org)
	- 8 hr day 
	- welcome working people
	- allowed women to rise to power
	- allowed black people to join but in Colored Alliances

## The "Ocala Demands" (1890) and the "Omaha Platform" (1892)
### Mary Elizabeth Lease
- Mother Jones figure for the Farmer's Alliance
- give speeches
- *"Raise less corn and **more hell**"*
- Can't just be having speeches tho, **must take POLITICAL ACTION** ---->>>

**NFA realized they need to get involved politically -> Ocala Demands and Omaha Platform**

- List of Grievances and Demands:
	1.  **Government "of the people"**
		- ***Referendums*** - ( post something to the vote of the people )
			- "Should weed be illegal?" -> "Yes/No"
	2. **Public ownership of the railroads**
		- *"If railroads are in private hands of industry, they will monopolize and screw you over"*
		- Have them run by the government
		- so that the railroads set fair rates
	3. **Direct Election of Senators/Graduated Income Tax**
		- **Allow People to Vote for Senators!!!**
			- back then only state gov't would choose for you
			- *(Coal owners would manipulate govt to pick their ideal Senators)*
		- **Graduated Income Tax:**
			- *The wealthier you are, the more you should be taxed*
				- "Tax Brackets"
	4. No Protective Tariffs for Industry, no Land Giveaways
	5. Restricting Immigration
		- "Focus on us, we don't need more problems" mindset
	6. **"Subtreasury System"**
		- prices are low
		- so govt should build storage facilities, where we'll put our crops there
		- basically, simulate scarcity so as to get crops off market when prices too low
		- wait until prices get high again to access storage silo and put the crops back on market
		- *(not sure if this would work ....)*
		- while crops sitting in silo, farmers could get loans for lower interest rate instead of high interest private loan
	7. **Free coinage of Silver**
		- **Back then, every dollar was backed up by gold**
		- **"Convert dollars to gold"**
		- *b/c gold is rare, not a lot of dollars out there*
		- Since farmers in debt, and dollars are rare, its hard to get dollars since they have to be backed by gold!
		- **So instead: Back with Silver too!!!**
		- **Silver will solve all of our problems**

## Populist Party
- Republicans and Democrats scared they will steal their votes

## Willian Jennings Bryan and "fusion" w/ Democrats
- Populist party fuses with Democrat candidate in order to win
- in the end they lose.......
- as political force they fail, but this suspicious idea of agrarian american will continue.......
