- moving from the "loss of faith" in the 1970s (Vietnam, Watergate) to the **Conservative Ascendancy** (or the "Reagan Revolution") of the 1980s.

- The "New Right" wasn't just about economics; it successfully merged three distinct groups into a single voting block:
	1. **Economic Conservatives:** Those who wanted lower taxes and deregulation.
	2. **Militant Anti-Communists:** Those who wanted a tougher stance against the Soviet Union.
	3. **The Religious Right:** This was the key addition. Unlike in the 1950s, when they were seen as fringe, by 1980, Christian conservatives became "respectable and legitimate" partners in the GOP.

### **Overarching Themes & Questions**
#### **1. The Role of Government: Dismantling the Great Society**
The "New Right" defined itself by what it was _against_.
- **The Question:** Is the federal government the solution to social problems (Liberal/Great Society view) or the problem itself (Conservative view)?
- **The New Right Argument:** They viewed the government as bloated and intrusive. They championed "small government, lower taxes, and deregulation" and viewed labor unions as a danger to free enterprise.
- **The Liberal Critique:** Critics argued that this "trickle-down" economics benefited the wealthy at the expense of the poor and middle class, while starving essential services like education and environmental protection.

#### **2. Who Is an American? (The Culture Wars)**
This chapter sees the "Who is an American?" question evolve into the **Culture Wars**. The definition of a "good American" becomes tied to "traditional values."
- **The New Right:** They linked their political principles to a **"Christian framework"**. They were unified by *hostility toward feminism, affirmative action, and the counterculture of the 1960s.*
- **The Liberal Critique:** They denounced the **Moral Majority** (the Religious Right organization) for *trying to impose specific religious values on a secular, diverse society.*


- They were united by a shared enemy: **Liberalism**. They bonded over hostility to the Great Society, war protesters, and challenges to traditional cultural values.


- **New Right Audience:** They aimed at the "Silent Majority"—white Southerners, religious Christians, and business owners who felt alienated by the cultural upheavals of the 60s and 70s.

- **Liberal/Critic Audience:** They aimed at secular voters, women (feminists supporting the ERA), minorities, and the working class who relied on government safety nets.
