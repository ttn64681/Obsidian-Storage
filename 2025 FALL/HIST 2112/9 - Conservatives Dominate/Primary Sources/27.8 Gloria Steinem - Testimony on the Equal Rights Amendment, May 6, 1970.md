This testimony by **Gloria Steinem** is the definitive primary source for **Second Wave Feminism**. It provides the **"Liberal" counter-argument to Phyllis Schlafly** (Source 27.7) and **frames the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)** not as a threat to tradition, but as a **necessary step toward basic human rights.**

Sex myths:
"That woman are biologically inferior to men. In fact, an equally good case can be made for the reverse. Women live longer than men, even when the men are not subject to business pressures. Women survived Nazi concentration camps better, keep cooler heads in emergencies currently studied by disaster-researchers, are protected against heart attacks by their female sex hormones, and are so much more durable at every stage of life that nature must conceive 20 to 50 percent more males in order to keep the balance going. However, I don’t want to prove the superiority of one sex to another. That would only be repeating a male mistake."

### **Key Main Points**

- **The Reality of Discrimination:** Steinem opens with concrete examples of how she is treated as a second-class citizen: being refused service in restaurants, denied apartment rentals, and excluded from jury duty and professional groups solely because she is a woman.
    
- **Comparison to Racial Justice:** She explicitly links the feminist struggle to the Civil Rights Movement. She notes that she faces discrimination "without the legal remedies available to blacks" and argues that women are socially conditioned to **"Uncle Tom"**—a loaded term meaning to act subservient to survive in a hostile system.
    
- **Debunking Biological Myths:** Steinem attacks the "myth" of female inferiority. She cites scientific data showing women live longer and survive disasters better than men. Crucially, she refuses to claim women are _superior_, stating that "would only be repeating a male mistake".
    
- **Reframing the Family:** Directly challenging the "traditional family" ideal, she argues that American children suffer from "too much mother, and too little father". She claims the idea that mothers must be full-time caregivers is a historical anomaly, not a universal truth.
    
- **Feminism is for Men, Too:** Steinem makes a strategic argument that "Women’s Liberation is Men’s Liberation too". She argues that if women share the economic burden, men will be relieved of the stress of being the "sole breadwinner," resulting in "fewer ulcers" and better relationships with their children.

### **Connecting to Big Themes & Questions**

#### **1. Who Is an American? (Second-Class Citizenship)**

Steinem addresses this theme by defining the current status of women as fundamentally un-American.

- **Analysis:** She argues she has been "denied a society in which women are encouraged, or even allowed to think of themselves as **first-class citizens**". While Schlafly argued women were a "privileged" class, Steinem argues they are a caste trained to "be, rather than achieve".
    

#### **2. The Role of Law (The Need for the ERA)**

- **Analysis:** Steinem argues that "sex based myths" have been "reflected in our laws". She is demanding the **Role of Law** change from enforcing gender roles to enforcing neutrality. Unlike Schlafly, who trusts the "free enterprise system" to help women, Steinem believes federal law is necessary to break the cycle of discrimination.

The most likely essay prompt for this chapter will ask you to **compare and contrast Schlafly (27.7) and Steinem (27.8)**. Here is the blueprint for that answer:

- **On Status:**
    
    - **Schlafly:** Women are the **"most privileged"** class in history, protected by chivalry and provided for by men.
        
    - **Steinem:** Women are **"second class"** citizens, denied basic rights like<span style="background:#fff88f"> jury duty and equal pay.</span>
        
- **On Men:**
    
    - **Schlafly:** Men are benevolent providers who work overtime to buy diamonds and life insurance for their wives.
        
    - **Steinem:** Men are victims of the system, too—overworked, ulcer-ridden "sole breadwinners" who are cut off from their children.
        
- **On Biology:**
    
    - **Schlafly:** Biology is destiny ("God made us" to have babies), and laws should reflect this.
        
    - **Steinem:** **Biology is a "myth" used to oppress;** women are actually physically durable, and laws should ignore biological differences to ensure equality.
