Phyllis Schlafly was an attorney, wife, and mother of six children. She had campaigned for Barry Goldwater in 1964 and successfully **led the antifeminist forces against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s**. In the excerpt below she explains her views on women.

- **Culture Wars** of the 1970s. **Phyllis Schlafly** was the single most effective opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). 
	- She successfully mobilized the **New Right coalition** by *framing feminism not as a movement for rights, <span style="background:#fff88f">but as an attack on the privileges of the American housewife.*</span>

*Of all the classes of people who ever lived, the American woman is the most privileged.* 
### **Key Main Points**

- **The "Privilege" Argument:** Schlafly completely flips the feminist narrative. While feminists argued women were oppressed, Schlafly argues that the American woman is "the most privileged" class in history, enjoying the "most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties".
    
- **Biology and God's Law:** She grounds her argument in religion and nature. The fact that "women have babies and men don’t" is a "fact of life" created by **God**, not a result of male oppression.
    
- **The Benefits of Chivalry:** She argues that women benefit from a "Christian Age of Chivalry" that puts them "on a pedestal". She claims that in America, men work hard to provide homes and financial security for their wives, a "tradition of special respect" that women would lose if they demanded total equality.
    
- **Capitalism as the Real Liberator:** Schlafly argues that the **"American free enterprise system"**, not feminism, is what truly liberated women. Innovations like "beautiful supermarkets" and appliances relieved women of drudgery, giving them time for other pursuits.
    
- **Feminism as an Assault:** She concludes by attacking the "women’s lib" movement as a fraud. She claims it is not about jobs, but is a **"total assault"** on the role of the wife and mother and on the family unit itself.

#### **1. The New Right Coalition (The Glue)**

Schlafly is the master of fusing the different elements of the New Right together in one speech.

- **Analysis:** Notice how she weaves **Social Conservatism** (defense of the family) with **Religion** (God's design, Christian Chivalry) and **Economic Conservatism** (praise for the "free enterprise system"). This explains why the New Right was so powerful—it convinced economic conservatives and religious fundamentalists that they were fighting the same enemy.
    

#### **2. Who Is an American? (Culture Wars & Nativism)**

Schlafly defines the "American way" by contrasting it with others in a way that reveals the racial and cultural biases of the movement.

- **Analysis:** She explicitly contrasts the "Christian Age of Chivalry" with "African and the American Indian" civilizations, which she stereotypes as societies where men "strut around wearing feathers" while women endure slavery. This reinforces the idea that "true" American culture is white, Christian, and rooted in European tradition, while dismissing other cultures as backward.
    

#### **3. The Role of Government vs. Free Enterprise**

- **Analysis:** Schlafly rejects government intervention (the ERA) as unnecessary because the **free market** has already solved the problem of women's labor. She argues that the "gigantic food and packaging industry" has done more for women than any law could.
