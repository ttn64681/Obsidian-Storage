- <u>Howard Jarvis</u>, ***a conservative Republican lobbyist, spearheaded a taxpayer revolt*** in California for *lower, fixed property taxes.* He devised Proposition 13 and gained sufficient signatures to place it on the ballot as a referendum initiative. In 1978 California voters adopted the measure by an overwhelming majority and set off a national movement for property tax relief.

### **Key Main Points of Proposition 13**
- **The 1% Cap:** The core of the law limited property taxes to a maximum of **1% of the property's value**. This was a massive reduction for many homeowners.
    
- **Capping Tax Growth:** Even if the market value of a home skyrocketed, the tax assessment value could not increase by more than **2% per year**. This protected long-time homeowners from inflation but severely limited government revenue growth.
    
- **The "Straitjacket" on Government (Supermajorities):** Perhaps the most powerful legacy is Section 3 and 4. It required a **two-thirds (supermajority) vote** in the state legislature to raise _any_ state taxes in the future. It also required a two-thirds vote of the local population for cities to impose special taxes. This made it constitutionally difficult for the government to ever raise revenue again.
#### **2. The Rise of the "Silent Majority" (Grassroots Conservatism)**

This connects to the **Political Realignment** theme.

- **Analysis:** Proposition 13 wasn't passed by a President or Congress; it was a **referendum initiative** spearheaded by a conservative activist (Howard Jarvis) and voted on directly by the people. It showed that the "anger" discussed in your lecture notes—anger at inflation, high taxes, and "wasteful" liberal programs—had boiled over into a populist movement.
#### **3. The Prelude to Reagan**

- **Analysis:** This happened in **California in 1978**. This is Ronald Reagan's home state (where he was Governor). The overwhelming success of Proposition 13 proved to national Republicans that running on a platform of "tax cuts" and "small government" was a winning strategy, setting the stage for Reagan's landslide victory in 1980. It proved the "New Right" coalition was ready to take power.
