# Iran-Contra Affair and Shadow of Watergate
- Way back in 1953:
	- **We overthrew the govt in Iran**
		- CIA only admitted this in 2023
	- We did this b/c 1953 they recently elected a guy (Mossadah) they didn't like:
		- Iranians sent their oil to other countries
		- "Why are we sending our oil to make other people rich?"
		- **Mossadah**: I will make sure Iranian Oil is National, and profits go to us!
	- This creates Communist scare somehow in America???
		- We cannot allow this guy to reign even though he was Democratically elected...
	- We instead support someone else: "Shah" (pro-western)
		- things that the Americans would appreciate
		- but had secret police going around brutally murdering their opponents
		- America helped overthrow govt indirectly
	- **America: "We support the ugly people as long as they are NOT COMMUNIST"**
	- "Shah was a staunch American ally in the Middle-East"

- **Fundamentalist Islamic Revolution Group - response to Shah in power by the Americans**
	- *Shah runs for his life, has to leave country*
	- has Cancer, needs Healthcare, wants to get treated in America
- *Jimmy Carter ->*
	- we are done w/ supporting Dictators just cause they're anti-Communists
	- gonna let human rights enforce our policies
	- NOT a fan of the Sha
	- but Shah was a staunch American ally!
	- can't send the Shah back to Iran since they'll kill him
	- Long story short:
		- Shah allowed to get hospitalized in America
- **Response in Iran: (Hostage)**
	- they're gonna cure him, then put him back in power in Iran
	- they did it in 1953, theyll do it again in 1979
	- So:
		- Take American embassy members as hostage
		- we'll give them back if you give us back Shah so he can be put on trial and punished for his crimes
		- *lasted 444 days*
- **Jimmy Carter: weird position, what do you do???**
	-  Shah ends up in Exile
	- First time we had faced Islamic Fundamentalism
	- The war of 9/11 started to happen here
	- worked hard to get the hostages released
	- ignominious end to an embarrassing decade
- Iran Protest:
	- "Vietnam wounded you, Iran will bury you"
		- This smarted us
		- Like an end of an awful decade

# Historical Background

1970s - most people we're right-wing. strong support of US b/c they weren't Communist
- el-salvador we're horrible, went around slaughtering people
## Nicaragua
- Revolution - Left wing group takes over (Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN))
	- Concern in the cold war days:
		- Containment: if **communists** make a move, you have to make a move to counter them
		- **Reagan was a huge anti Communist, didn't like Sandinista**
		- So, we start seeing what we can do about Communism in Nicaragua
- **The Contras - rebel group opposing Leftist govt in Nicaragua**
	- Reagan supported them: Compared them to freedom fighters, minute-men

## Hasbullah
- taken American hostages in Lebanon
- **Reagan has to negotiate with Iranians**
	- *"I don't negotiate w/ terrorists, NOT like Jimmy Carter"*
	- Secretly, he's negotiation, lol
	- Doing exactly what he criticized the Jimmy Carter Administration
### Plan
- Iranians will return us hostages and money, we'll give them weapons
- why they want weapons?
	- because they're in war against Iraqis
	- They NEED weapons
	- fine we'll give you a bunch of weapons
#### HUGE PR Problem
- <span style="background:#fff88f">NOT only did he say he doesn't negotiate with terrorists, HE'S GIVING THEM WEAPONS WTFFFFF</span>

What do we do with this money now?
- take that money, drop it into the Nicaraguan Contras!
- We'll fund the overthrow of the Nicaraguan Govt!

# Boland Amendments
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS
- 
## CIA Response:
- we'll do this in secret
- AND we'll LIE about it! XD

**Reagan:**
- "We need to keep the Nicaraguans alive in body and soul"
Who's responisble???
- Oliver north?

**We find out:**
- Congressional investigation 1986:
	- Televised
- Oliver North:
	- 
- Eugene Hasunfus

Reagan decides to launch an investigation
- Oliver North put under oath
	- THE MASTERMIND
