# Patterns in History
## Computer/Internet Revolution
### Old vs New Industrialism
- Old: "What does industrialism do to democracy?"
- Now: "What does internet do to democracy?"

### Same Problems Now
- **Old**: Industrialism with Railroad Construction, could get away with a lot more with little regulation since it was New
- **New**: Bitcoin mining, could get away with a lot more with little regulation in Texas, but locals complain about noise

	- Artisans and Weavers scared of being put out of business by machines
	- Typers (type-writers) scared of being put out of business by Microcomputers
	- Coders scared of being put out of business by AI

- Hard labor in a factory or a field is STILL ONGOING
	- issues over pay
	- issues over job security
	- these issues have shaped out the political/electoral landscape

## 9/11 and the "new containment"
### The "War" on Terror
- containing terrorism
	- albeit the definition of terrorism is infamously loose

### Patriot Act
- expanded govt's surveillance powers
- easier to monitor comms and access personal records in the name of national security

 Saddam Hussain
- Not
- people wanted to use 9/11 as excuse to remake Middle-East and create American friendly machine
- So we invaded them
	- excuse: Saddam had WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction)
		- This was FALSE, MANUFACTURED by the govt
	- lots of pro-war stuff (yellow journalism, )
		- similar to Spanish-American war

- Similar to Tonkin Gulf Incident
	- US claimed North Vietnamese launched bombs destroying Gulf of Tonkin 1964
		- used to pass Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, escalating US involvement in Vietnam

## Immigration and Nativism
- FEAR
	- weird and dangerous practices
	- dangerous ideologies
		- Anarchy, Communism, Socialism
	- bringing in disease
		- Chinese
	- bringing in poverty

### Same Old Problems
- "Covid was a Chinese engineered disease to attack America"
	- anti-Asian/Chinese rhetoric

## 2008 Economic Collapse
- unemployment hit 10-17%
- stock market crashed, 30-40%
- hiring freeze at UGA
- no raises

- People Fearful
- People ANGY at Govt

- Like 1970s
	- Oil Crisis
	- Financial Strains of Vietnam
	- not a Great Depression but long stretch of time where high inflation

- There is solace in the fact that nothing is TRULY UNPRECENTED
