#### Reconstruction - Reuniting Seceded South with North Union
**What does Reconstruction mean?**
- To bring 11 states seceded during Civil War‚Ä¶ FAILED, now being brought back in

#### Snapshot of America, 1865
- Need for big transformation
- Most people In North (Dominant) - some freedman
- Most slaves in South
- Freedman don't have a stable standing in society or place of safety

#### Leaders of Reconstruction
- Lincoln believed in relatively quick and easy Reconstruction
- Presidential Reconstruction and 10% Plan

	**LINCOLN - Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863)**
	Told Southern seceded states to:
	- Rewrite Const to renounce their right to secession
	- Reject Slavery via 13th Amend
	- 10% of people must declare loyalty to US
		- In reality, only includes small white population

	**ANDREW JOHNSON and Reconstruction -**
	- Was the only major Southerner who didn‚Äôt join the Confederacy
	- Hates rich planters
	- Rewarded as Vice President by Lincoln

	- HATES BLACK PEOPLE EVEN MOREEE
	- A lot of White Southerners joined Union Army b/c they didn‚Äôt like the Confederacy being made up of rich planters
	- _His Reconstruction was SUPER LAX b/c he doesn‚Äôt want to integrate Black People_ üò≠
	
	- _Hates black people more than rich white_
	
	- _People think he was a Confederate Agent lmao_
	- _Danger of Confederacy coming back (CIVIL WAR 2.0)_

#### 4. Radical Reconstruction - the ‚Äúget tough‚Äù approach
- ‚ö†Ô∏èEvidence of South Coming Back‚Ä¶.
- **Black Codes**
	- Forerunner of segregation laws
	- Passed by state govt‚Äôs in South after Civil War
	- Described what black people COULD and COULD NOT DO
		- COULD NOT BE UNEMPLOYED
		- COULD NOT TRAVEL W/O EMPLOYER

- Bringing Back Slavery‚Ä¶ and Andrew Johnson is helping Southern Confederates!!!
- Radical Republicans HATE Johnson b/c of this

  

- Radical Republicans Try to Win Back Elections:

- Johnson fights against them b/c he says they will help black people üò±
- BUT RADICALS WIN!!!!!

  

- Radicals Obtains ‚Öî veto overturn:
	1. Radicals Make a Bunch Of Bills
	2. Andrew Johnson Vetoes them
	3. Radicals Mostly Overturn Them

	- 14th Amendment: Black People are Citizens if born/naturalized in U.S. soil
	- 15th Amendment: Prohibits denying right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude
		- Doesn‚Äôt include women ( r i p )

- Force Acts - combatted KKK

- Freedmen‚Äôs Bureau (1865) - U.S. fed agency to aid freedmen (formerly enslaved people) in South during Reconstruction

#### 5. Impeaching Andrew Johnson
- Impeaching Andrew Johnson - Dubious Scheme by Radicals :
	- Deliberately pass law that will piss AJ off to bait him to break law ‚Äî> impeachable
	- ‚ÄúTenure of Office Act‚Äù
	- AJ fires secretary of defense (Edwin Stanton - Radical, Lincoln)
	- Johnson narrowly misses impeachment by a SINGLE VOTE (NOOOOOO)
	- But doesn‚Äôt have a lot of months left, basically powerless

- Republican President (Woohoo!!! ‚Ä¶. or not???)
- Northerners drop the ball‚Ä¶
- They abandon formerly enslaved people
- ‚ÄúRECONSTRUCTION FATIGUE‚Äù
	1. Financial weariness
	2. Panic of 1873 - economic crisis
		- Care more about their family than black people
	3. SCOTUS rulings
		- After Reconstruction, soldiers are pulled out, meaning LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI-SLAVE LAWS
	4. Northern white supremacy

- RESURGE IN RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY
- KKK
- Shooting Blacks if they Vote Wrong


**IMPORTANT POINTS - Reconstruction 1 :**
- RECONSTRUCTION NEEDS TO BE A PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION
	- Integration, Loyalty to US
- PEOPLE WILL FIGHT OVER HOW MUCH CHANGE
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?

- LINCOLN - PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION (1863)

- SOUTHERN STATES MUST: Renounce right to secession, Reject Slavery via 13th, and 10% must declare loyalty to US
- Wanted Fairly Lax and Easy Reconstruction

- ANDREW JOHNSON (SOUTHERNER)

- HATES BLACK PEOPLE ‚Äî> SUPER LAX RECONSTRUCTION
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">‚ö†Ô∏èDANGER‚ö†Ô∏è</mark>: CONFEDERACY WILL COME BACK, CIVIL WAR 2.0!!!
  
- Slavery Coming Back: BLACK CODES

- Racists Fighting Against Northern Republicans
- BUT THE RADICALS WINNNNN!!!!!!!!!!

- 14th,¬† defined citizenship to include those born in US (freedmen)
- 15th, prohibited suffrage rights denial based on race, color, or previous servitude
- Force Acts - protect black people from KKK
- Freedmen‚Äôs Bureau - U.S. fed agency to aid freedmen in South

- Not as great as you may think

End of Reconstruction
- Reconstruction FATIGUE

- FINANCIAL WEARINESS
- PANIC OF 1873 - ECONOMIC CRISES, didn‚Äôt care about black people more than their own families
- SCOTUS rulings

- Weakened Reconstruction Amendments (14th), narrowly interpreting scope and limiting Congress‚Äôs power to enforce civil rights
- (Essentially Backtracking)
- Result? => Jim Crow segregation and racial discrimination by emphasizing ‚Äústate action‚Äù over private wrongs and allowing for ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù systems.

- Northern white supremacy

- THE FINAL ACT - Compromise of 1877

- Informal agreement b/w southern Democrats and allies of Republican Rutherford Hayes to settle result of 1876 election
- Democrats agreed not to block Hayes‚Äô victory on condition that Republicans withdraw all federal troops from South, thus consolidating Democratic control over the region
- End of Reconstruction era
