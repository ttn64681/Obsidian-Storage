# WW2 done

- Germany is defeated (1945)
	- crushed in middle b/w France and Britain and Soviet Army Troops
	- "Defeated Fascism"
	- Germans are replaced by Soviet Union as #1 Foreign Policy ENEMY

- Soviet Union:
	- First ever country founded on communism
	- You'd imagine U.S. didn't have best relations w/ them
	- How could we be allies w/ them in WW2?
		- Germany was so bad we had to unite to defeat Nazi Germany
		- (Most of the work was done by the Soviets)
			- Lost 20 million troops
			- In comparison, America lost (way less amount)

# Communist Fear
## Democracy/Capitalism vs Communism:
- America:
	- New Deal was effort to FIX capitalism
- Soviet Union:
	- Full on communist system;  Ideological rival to America

<span style="background:#fff88f"> - Sum up Foreign Policy in one word: CONTAINMENT</span>

- General George S. Patton
- "We got WW2 done, Soviets are right here... let's go ahead and finish WW3 right here and defeat them!"
	- get's killed in car accident (rip)

## Joseph Stalin
- Soviets secure their position in Eastern Europe
- Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania are ALL basically under control of Soviet Union
	- America scared...
	- Solution? -> We need Containment!!!

## George Kennan
- says "Russia has history of conquering other places. Just because they're Communist, doesn't mean they're gonna stop."
- Therefore, U.S. must contain Soviet Union

## Containment
- What does containment mean?
	- Wherever Soviet Union moves, U.S. blocks them over here
		- like a chess game
		- <font color="#4f81bd">Primary Source: </font>
			- *George Kenna in front of Chess Board with White Piece the White House and Red Piece the Soviet Union*

## U.S. Govt "philosophy"
- U.S. has obligation to fix problems
	- to use its federal powers to deploy active policies to fix things
-  George Kennan: "The government should actively try to fix the Communist problem"
- Liberals are ANTI-COMMUNISTS!!!

# Harry S. Truman
- Harry S. Truman takes over for FDR after his death:
	- is a Liberal
	- Is EXCITED/FASCINATED by this idea of "*Containment"*

## Greece - Aftermath of Nazi takeover... 
- Nazi takes over Greece
- Nazi loses war
- Greece left in weird broken state
- group on political left and political right
- **Greece Civil War** to see who will lead the country

- British no longer have money to help aid Greece (who are fascists)
- Harry S. Truman says "YES!"
	- b/c this is a great opportunity for Containment!
- **Result:**
	- **Greek Right Monarch are defeated by Greek Left Party**
	- Harry S. Truman: "This is great! Victory #1 in Cold War! "
		- deliberately panicked people to get funding for this war

## ii. "Monolithic Communism"
1. Definition = "all communists, anywhere in the world, are unde the control of the Soviet Union"
2. Reality = not true; lots of rivalries, divisions, etc.


- Does Containment have to always include Killing People????
- George Kennan -> "NO!! Use your financial Strength, Foreign aid, to do your containment!" 
## Marshall Plan (1947)
### Motivation:
- Europe in trouble. They've had nasty war and NEED AID. It's the right thing to do from humanitarian POV but also smart thing to do **politically**
- If we aid Europe, they will be less likely to go fascist again!!!
	- Hungry people are angry people
	- People who are hungry and jobless and angry are more likely to start a revolution
	- People who are housed, fed, and clothed, are NOT REVOLUTIONARY!!!
- Political Cartoon:
	- Little girl who is fed... 
	- "MILK ... new weapon of Democracy!"
	- Feeding people / aiding people will save them from Communism!!!

### Support:
- U.S. pours a tremendous amount of aid to Europe
- Essentially like a "New Deal" for Europe
	- stimulate their economy
- has bi-partisan support
	- "maybe someday EU may learn to cooperate w/ each other, and form a Union!!"
		- Foresaw the European Union (current EU union)

**Primary Source:**
- For Context:
	- Soviet Union only allowed pictures/art to be pro-Soviet Union
	- mindless propaganda
- *The painting:*
	- **basically A bunch of spaghetti mess**
		- *symbolizes FREEDOM of doing whatever they want*
	- "The jazz representation in art-form"
	- CIA sponsored these types of art to spread American ideals
	- CIA sponsored jazz musicians in Europe
		- Ex: Louise Armstrong

# Cold War "Non-violent Battles"
- Someday were gonna have to have a single Germany
- **Question: Whose side is Germany gonna be on during Cold War**

## Stalin
- Stalin is scared of Germany falling into hands of America
## America
- We don't care about East Germany, we just focus on West Germany
- Introduces new currency into West Germany to enforce control over it and help them
- Stalin retaliates by holding West Berlin hostage -> **Blockade**
## Berlin held hostage
- Context: A tiny chip of land that is free from Soviet Union control and Communism
	- **Blockade**: cuts off its access to highways and everything...
	- **"We won't give it back until you back off!!"**

-  Problem: Either
	- Dont do anything and seem weak
	- Do something and start a World War 3!!

## Solution: Berlin Air-Dropping Resources!
- Pilots flying 3 times a day from East to West Germany:
	- Dropping off food and coal and supplies everyday to keep it alive
- Political Cartoon:
	- Stalin wondering if he should shoot airplanes down
- Political Cartoon:
	- chess game b/w Truman and Stalin

- This goes on for a year!
- We gain MAJOR SUPPORT and PR from Europe and Germany!

## Finally, Stalin gives up:
- Stalin ends the blockade...
- Europe celebrating!

-  BUT THEN.......

# China Goes Communist ðŸ˜±
- Ever since ... there has been civil war going on in China
- Long story short: 1949, chinese communists are victorious
	- World's most populated country at the time has JUST GONE COMMUNIST
	- All anti-communists fled China and went to Taiwan
- EXTREMELY scary to Americans...

- People point fingers in America:
	- Whose fault is this???
	- Brian Drake: "America has a main character syndrome"
		- "Somehow something we did or didn't cause this"... no its the Chinese who did this obviously, not everythings by America

# UH OH -> SOVIET UNION GETS NUCLEAR BOMB!!!
- Communist Fear INTENSIFIES
- now things are getting interesting...
- "There must be spies buried deep in America giving them info about America's weapons!!!"
	- were there spies? yes, but probably not that significant. but few spies that existed only fanned the flame

- Very famous "Top Secret" Document, that basically told people to RESPOND or else things'll go BAD...
- Motivates Truman to start getting violent...

## North Korea vs South Korea
- Context: Split into 2, North and South Korea
- North is communist - supported by Soviet Union, 
- South is not communist - supported by US

-  One Day, North Koreans invade the South with backing of Soviet Union
- Almost takes over the whole thing very quickly
- Get pushed all the way to the bottom corner of South Korean Peninsula

### Who saves the day?  Saved by General Douglas
- Makes the North Koreans retreat
- we chase them all the way up to the Chinese Border
- Chinese become nervous from this... Americans charging all the way up to China's broder
	- afraid they'll invade China
	- General Douglas: "What the hell, we're already here so we might as well nuke a few Chinese Cities"

### Chines retaliates
- Chinese launch an invasion
- For next 3 years, America and China fights back and forth at the middle point of korea, but middle line never really changes much

### Armistice signed
- Armistice signed
	- Korea looks the exact same as it did in the beginning:
		- North is communist
		- South is not
		- (Still is like this today!)

# Red Scare
- Out of frustration and fear, Americans start turning on each other
	-  "You lost the war to Korea!"
	- "You are secretly harboring Communist intentions!"
- was everywhere even in religion:
	- The new immorality was not sex and drugs, but Communism

- A pretty scary time:

## Lavender Scare...
