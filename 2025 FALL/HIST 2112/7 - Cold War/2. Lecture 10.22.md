# Film Lavender Scare
Soon after taking office in 1953, President  Dight eiseinghower ordered the firing of all homosexuals in the military (2,200 employees)
- new employees now screened for their sexuality

As the US was gripped in terror of communist spies infiltrating the US, society believed that gay men and lesbian women were susceptible to blackmail 
- "the pervert is easy prety to the blackmailer"
- but there was no evidence of gay individuals betraying the government due to blackmail
- purging of gays people in the government begin

In this era, gay men and lesbian women are trying their best to live quiet lives and stay out of sight. However investigators still found ways out to discover them.
- anecdote of new college grad loosing her US Department of Commerce job after being investigated by FBI
- Rizzi US Navy Veteran, postal office, honorably discharged after being investigated to being a homosexual
	- they cross dressed
- people would just be called in, legal representation not allowed, essentially no due process
	- no formal hearing
- many lose jobs
- people start outing people they know who they suspect to be gay or lesbian

US authority would now harass gay bars.
- very often the arrests were just harassment
- kept over night but no charges
- however, your name being publicized could ruin your life

Even in their own homes, gay and lesbian individuals were not safe

Lifetime of job struggles followed after being exposed as being queer.

25 years earlier, there wasn't such discrimination.
- New Deal many young women and men moving to cities that were more open minded 

**WW2 considered revolutionary for gay men**
- total mobilization pulls primarily young men and women out of their family and small rural town environments into military, same sex environments

- sense of security due to being the sole owner of nuclear weapons
	- however China falls to communism, Soviet Union growing in power

1948 Alfred Kinsely published Sexual behavior in the American male
- said that 37% of men have had homosexual experiences to the point of orgasm
- not what Americans wanted t ohear 
- said to have destroyed the reputation of American men
- 1948 the year everybody in the US was afraid of homosexuality

Two things that america is worried about -> **communism and queer -> come together and are targeted as one**

By the 1950s, very few communists in the government but some believed there were still security risks -> **homosexuals**

Red Scare morphs in to homosexuals.

Senate admits they could not find a case of homosexuals being blackmailed into spilling government secrets but...

Cleaning house meant getting rid of the Democrats soft on communism and homosexuals.

republican officials played into the homosexual issue as much as possible.

**One of Eisenhowers first official acts was that homosexuals could not vote...**

Witch Hunts began.

Began to cascade as police would press arrested homosexuals for other names.

People forced into the closet.
- common practice for gay men and lesbian women to not use their real names 

People even committed suicide for being found as homosexuals
