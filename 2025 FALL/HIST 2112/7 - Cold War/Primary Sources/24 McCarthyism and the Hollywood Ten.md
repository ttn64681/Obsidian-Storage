## Evaluate the power of McCarthyism by explaining **why so few people challenged** *McCarthy*, *HUAC* (**House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)**), and *other anti-Communist investigators*.

- 10 friendly and 10 unfriendly witnesses (suspects)

## Answer : the consequences for resisting were *personally and professionally devastating.*

- **The Government's Power:** HUAC, a committee of the U.S. Congress, held "headline-grabbing" investigations to expose supposed Communist influence in Hollywood. They had the power to subpoena citizens and demand they testify.
    
- **The Price of Defiance:** When the **"Hollywood Ten"** refused to answer questions by invoking the First Amendment (free speech), they were not protected. Instead, they were **held in contempt of Congress, fined, and sent to jail**.
    
- **The Power of the Blacklist:** This is the most crucial point. The government's actions, combined with the cooperation of "friendly" studio heads like Walt Disney and Jack Warner, created the **blacklist**. This was an informal list that meant thousands of writers, actors, and technicians lost their jobs and were unable to find work.
    
- **Life-Ruining Consequences:** The blacklist wasn't just a career setback; it was life-ruining. It broke apart families, forced people to leave the country, and even led to suicide.
    

### Connecting to Big Questions

- **The Role of Government:** This is a chilling example of the **darker side of government power**. <span style="background:#fff88f">Unlike the New Deal</span>, which expanded government to **provide a social safety net**, *HUAC used the government's power as a* <span style="background:#fff88f">weapon to enforce political conformity and crush dissent</span>. It actively **undermined the First Amendment rights** it was supposed to protect.
    
- **Who Is an American?:** McCarthyism fundamentally changed the definition of a "true" American. "Friendly" witnesses like Ronald Reagan could publicly affirm their loyalty and anti-Communism. 
	- *Those who refused to "name names" or who held left-leaning views were branded as "un-American"* and treated as enemies of the state. Your loyalty was no longer assumed; it had to be proven.
