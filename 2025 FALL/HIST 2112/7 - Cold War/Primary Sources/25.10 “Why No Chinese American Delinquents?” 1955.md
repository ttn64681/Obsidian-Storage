**Asian Americans had faced a great deal of prejudice from whites, especially on the West Coast. However, after World War II, the hard work and striving of Japanese and Chinese Americans to succeed reversed the traditional prejudices of many white Americans toward them, especially the younger generation. As the following magazine article shows, whereas teenagers in general were a source of concern for older Americans, <span style="background:#fff88f">Chinese teenagers were perceived as a “model minority.”</span>**

- This 1955 _Saturday Evening Post_ article is a key document for understanding the **"Who Is an American?"** theme, as it establishes the concept of the **"model minority"**.

-<span style="background:#fff88f"> In an era defined by widespread adult anxiety over "juvenile delinquency," this article portrays Chinese American teenagers as a perfect, non-threatening, and conforming group. </span>The source notes that judges and police in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago were "astonished" by the total lack of delinquency among an estimated 10,000 Chinese American teenagers.

The article's explanation, provided by the Chinese consul-general, is that this is due to **"filial piety"**—a cultural tradition of respecting and obeying parents. He states that a Chinese child "is anxious to please his parents before he pleases himself". This source holds up Chinese American teens as an ideal _precisely because_ they are not rebellious. This "model minority" image stands in stark contrast to the violent exclusion of Black teenagers in Little Rock (Source 25.8) and the cultural alienation of Mexican American teenagers in Texas (Source 25.9).


## Interpret the Evidence

- **Analyze which information in these documents confirms or challenges commonly held beliefs about teenagers in the 1950s.** The sources both confirm and challenge the "poodle skirt" and "malt shop" image of the 1950s teen.
    
    - **Confirm:** Dick Clark's advice book on becoming "date bait" (Source 25.6) and Charlotte Jones's passionate letter about Elvis (Source 25.7) both confirm the "common belief" that white teen culture was dominated by dating, popularity, and rock 'n' roll.
        
    - **Challenge:** The other sources shatter this image by revealing the experiences of non-white teenagers. The photo of Elizabeth Eckford (Source 25.8) shows a Black teenager facing a violent mob, not worrying about a date. Gloria Lopez-Stafford's memoir (Source 25.9) shows a Mexican American teen facing a crisis of cultural identity in her own classroom. The article on Chinese Americans (Source 25.10) shows a teen culture defined by "filial piety," not rebellion.
        
- **Compare the assumptions about adults and teenagers in Sources 25.6 and 25.10. How do they differ... from those written by teens (Sources 25.7 and 25.9)?** The adult-written sources are prescriptive, treating teens as a group to be managed, while the teen-written sources are emotional, expressing the internal conflicts of being a teenager.
    
    - **Adult Sources:** Dick Clark (25.6) assumes teens _want_ to conform and his book is a manual for achieving this. The _Post_ article (25.10) praises Chinese American teens for their conformity and lack of a generation gap.
        
    - **Teen Sources:** Charlotte Jones (25.7) is defiant, claiming a cultural identity separate from and superior to adults ("their taste isn’t quite as good as ours"). Gloria Lopez-Stafford (25.9) is "angry and confused," showing the personal, internal pain of being an outsider.
        
- **Evaluate what Sources 25.7 and 25.10 tell us about generational differences.** They present two opposite poles of the "generation gap."
    
    - **Source 25.7 (Elvis Letter):** This is the definitive document of the generation gap. Charlotte Jones is openly "scornful" of the adult world and draws a clear line: "if you’re over 30, you’re old".
        
    - **Source 25.10 (Chinese Americans):** This article describes a culture with _no_ generation gap. It praises these teens precisely because they have "reverence for elders" and are "anxious to please his parents".
        
- **Assess what these sources, especially 25.8, tell us about racial and ethnic differences among teenagers in the postwar era.** These sources show there was no single "teenager" experience; the "problem" of being a teen was entirely different based on race.
    
    - **White Teens:** Their struggles were cultural (popularity, dating) and generational (rock 'n' roll).
        
    - **Black Teens:** Their struggle was for fundamental citizenship and physical safety. Source 25.8 shows Elizabeth Eckford facing a violent mob and requiring the **Role of Government** (federal troops) just to attend school.
        
    - **Mexican American Teens:** Their struggle was cultural and psychological. They were legally integrated but were taught by their school that their heritage was "villainous".
        
    - **Chinese American Teens:** Their experience was defined by the "model minority" stereotype. They were praised by white society for being the opposite of the rebellious white teen.

## Put It in Context

- **How did the economy, politics, and culture of the postwar period (1945–1960) influence teen life in this era?**
    
    - **Economy:** The postwar economic boom created widespread affluence and a new, powerful consumer demographic: "Teenagers of America, Inc.". This economic power fueled their cultural dominance in music, fashion, and media.
        
    - **Politics (Cold War):** The Cold War fostered a intense pressure for **conformity**. This created the "squeaky-clean" ideal seen in Dick Clark's book and the "model minority" praise in Source 25.10, as any rebellion was seen as a potential threat.
        
    - **Politics (Civil Rights):** Simultaneously, the **Role of Government** was being challenged by the Civil Rights Movement. Federal court orders and the use of federal troops, as seen in Little Rock, placed Black teenagers at the very center of the nation's most significant political and moral struggle.
        
    - **Culture:** This resulted in a split-screen reality. The dominant white pop culture was defined by a new, rebellious "generation gap", while the lives of minority teens were defined by their struggle to be included in the "American" story.
