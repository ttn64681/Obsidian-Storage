Playwright and screenwriter John Howard Lawson was a founding member of the Screen Writers Guild. He was also a member of the American Communist Party and served as the party’s cultural commissar in Hollywood, and many of his films included leftist political themes. In 1947 Lawson appeared before HUAC. The following selection shows several attempts by the committee to force Lawson’s compliance. Like the other Hollywood Ten, Lawson was imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer HUAC’s questions or detail his political affiliations.

- This testimony is a raw, real-time battle over the **Role of Law** and the **First Amendment**. 
- Lawson, one of the "Hollywood Ten," stakes his entire defense on the **Bill of Rights**, arguing that HUAC's questions about his political affiliations are fundamentally illegal and "invade the basic rights of American citizens". 
- He insists the committee has no right to inquire about his beliefs, whether he is "Protestant, Methodist, Jewish, or Catholic, whether they be Republicans or Democrats or anything else".

## Redefining "American"

This source also provides a starkly different answer to the question, **"Who Is an American?"**
- **HUAC's Definition:** An American is _not_ a *Communist*. Loyalty is proven by cooperating with the government and answering all questions. <span style="background:#fff88f">Refusal to answer is seen as an admission of guilt.</span>
- **Lawson's Definition:** An American is someone whose right to "beliefs, affiliations, and everything else" is protected from government inquiry by the Constitution. He attempts to "teach this committee the basic principles of American[ism]".

This testimony is the perfect foil to Ronald Reagan's (Source 24.6). **Reagan was "friendly," validated the committee's premise, and saved his career**. *Lawson was "unfriendly," challenged the committee's legitimacy by comparing them to Nazis in **"Hitler Germany"***, and was subsequently destroyed for it. 
- This contrast shows the immense pressure to conform and the devastating personal cost of defiance.
