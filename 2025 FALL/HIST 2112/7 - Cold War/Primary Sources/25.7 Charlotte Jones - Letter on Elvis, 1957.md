**Nothing highlighted the growing generation gap more than rock ‘n’ roll.** When Elvis Presley burst onto the music scene in the mid-1950s, **adults criticized his music** and gyrating hips, while teenage boys dressed to imitate his style, and teenage girls screamed and fainted at his concerts. In 1957 *Charlotte Jones, an admiring fan, wrote the following letter to the conservative newspaper columnist George Sokolsky in response to Sokolsky’s criticism of Presley’s popularity.*

" There are too many people saying that Elvis is going to die out. When Elvis dies out is when the sun quits burning. "

- captures the new, defiant identity of the teenager and their power as a distinct cultural force.
### A Declaration of Generational Independence

Jones's letter is a passionate defense of Elvis Presley, but its real subject is the cultural power of her generation. She explicitly frames the conflict as a battle between "we (teens of America)" and adults.

- **Rejection of Adult Authority:** She dismisses adult criticism as simple "jealousy" and boldly asserts, "They’re mad because their taste isn’t quite as good as ours". This is a direct rejection of the traditional hierarchy where adults set cultural standards.
    
- **A New Pantheon:** Her **comparison of Elvis to George Washington** is a radical claim. It shows that her generation is creating its own set of heroes, elevating a rock 'n' roll star to the same immortal status as a founding father.
    
- **Defining the Divide:** The letter ends with a defiant and clear boundary: "P.S.: And if you’re over 30, you’re old". This defines the "teenager" not just as an age group, but as a separate, superior cultural identity.
    

### Connecting to the Big Questions

- It's not just about _legal_ citizenship, but about **cultural and racial conformity**.

This source directly addresses the theme of **Who Is an American?** by showcasing the rise of the "teenager." This new identity was so powerful that it had its own heroes (Elvis, James Dean) and its own cultural products (rock 'n' roll). 
This letter is the voice of "Teenagers of America, Inc.", a new economic and cultural force that, as Jones proves, was self-aware and fiercely protective of its new-found influence. 
It provides a stark contrast to the conformist, "date bait" world of Dick Clark, showing the rebellious and passionate energy that adults found so threatening.
