## Examine how teenagers affected the U.S. economy, culture, and politics in the postwar period (1945–1961).

- celebrated as a massive new consumer force, 
- yet feared as a source of social rebellion.

## The Teenager as an Economic and Cultural Force

The postwar economic boom, combined with the emerging "baby boomer" generation, created a new demographic with unprecedented influence.

- **Economic Power:** Dick Clark called this group **"Teenagers of America, Inc."**. They had their own disposable income and "shaped the advertising and manufacture of products".
    
- **Cultural Power:** This economic power translated into cultural dominance. This generation "made **rock ‘n’ roll** into an enduring and lucrative entertainment industry" and became the focus of TV shows like _American Bandstand_. This created the pop culture stereotype of poodle skirts, Elvis Presley, and malt shops.
    

## Complicated Realities and Racial Divides

This project argues that the "squeaky-clean" image hides more complex realities.

- **The "Rebel":** Alongside the "going steady" image was a deep-seated fear of **"juvenile delinquency,"** captured by films like _Rebel Without a Cause_. The introduction points to the era's conflicting images, like Sandra Dee's roles as both the perky _Gidget_ and an unwed pregnant teen.
    
- **The "Serious" Teen:** Teenagers were not just consumers; they were also deeply engaged with the era's anxieties. They "grew up under the looming threat of the Cold War, the Korean War, and McCarthyism".
    
- **Racial Exclusion:** This is a crucial theme. The public image of the "all-American" teen was almost **"exclusively white"**. This cultural image ignored the fact that "African Americans helped popularize rock ‘n’ roll". Most importantly, it obscured the reality of **Black teenagers**, <span style="background:#fff88f">who were on the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement, risking their lives to desegregate public school</span>s in places like Little Rock, Arkansas. This chapter directly addresses the **Who Is an American?** theme by showing how this new identity was racially segregated.
