**Born in 1937, Gloria Lopez-Stafford grew into her teenage years in the 1950s. While African Americans were fighting for integrated schools in neighboring Arkansas, Lopez-Stafford and her friends attended interracial schools. Still, as she relates in the following excerpt from her memoir, attending classes with whites did not necessarily satisfy Mexican American youths.**

- addresses the theme of **Who Is an American?** by revealing the profound difference between legal integration and true cultural belonging.

### The Classroom as a Cultural Battlefield

This source shows how public institutions, in this case, the school system, actively defined who was a "true American" or, in this case, a "true Texan". While the school was legally integrated, its curriculum and culture were tools of exclusion.

- **A Hostile Narrative:** The school's celebration of "Remember the Alamo!" with a banner and a film portrayed Mexicans as "small, overdressed" villains and Anglos as "big white men" and "heroes". This official narrative, reinforced by the teacher, created a hostile environment that defined Mexican Americans as the enemy.
    
- **The Personal Cost of Exclusion:** The film and the lesson made Lopez-Stafford feel "uncomfortable," "sick," and "painfully aware of being Mexican". The curriculum's message had a direct real-world consequence, empowering a white classmate to yell, "Texas is for Texans!" and shove her. The source shows her "angry and confused" tears, the direct result of a public institution teaching her that her identity was incompatible with being a hero.

- This source provides a crucial contrast to both the desegregation crisis in Little Rock (Source 25.8) and the white-centric pop culture (Sources 25.6, 25.7).
    
- Unlike the situation in Little Rock, where the **Role of Government** (federal troops) was used to _enforce_ legal integration against a mob, here the government (the public school) was the institution _promoting_ the cultural exclusion.
    
- While Dick Clark's white teens were focused on becoming "date bait" and Charlotte Jones's fans were engaged in a cultural rebellion over Elvis, this source shows Mexican American teens being forced to choose sides in a historical conflict and whispering, "Who did you cheer for?". Their experience of being a teenager was defined by this forced choice between their heritage and their "American" identity.
