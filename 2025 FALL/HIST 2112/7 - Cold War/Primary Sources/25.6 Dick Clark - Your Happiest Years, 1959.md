By 1959 Dick Clark was a nationally popular disc jockey and host of television’s American Bandstand. Always seen in a suit and tie, Clark, with his clean-cut good looks, projected a more wholesome vision of rock ‘n’ roll than did many of his contemporaries, such as Alan Freed. **Clark’s advice book for teenagers includes instructions on manners, makeup, and getting along with parents and other teens, as well as advice on romantic relationships**

This source, from _American Bandstand_ host Dick Clark, is a primary artifact of the new, mainstream "teenager" culture of the 1950s. It functions as a how-to guide for social conformity, defining success not through academics or civic engagement, but through popularity.

### A Manual for Social Conformity

- Positions dating as the central goal of the teenage years. Clark provides step-by-step instructions on how to become **"date bait,"** advising teens to join school groups, attend church activities, and build a "wide circle of friends" to achieve the "all-important phone call" for a date. 
- The advice promotes a specific, "wholesome" personality, urging teens to overcome shyness or physical insecurities ("Braces on your teeth can't dim the glow of a sparkling personality") because their "fellow teenagers are eager to find sincere friends". 
- **The focus is entirely on social adjustment and fitting in.**

### The "Who Is an American?" Theme

- It provides a blueprint for the ideal 1950s teenager: a socially active, well-adjusted, and popular person focused on dating rituals.
...
We should contrast this source with the realities it ignores. 
- The project introduction notes that this vision of the teenager was **"exclusively white"**. Clark's advice book creates a powerful cultural image of the "all-American" teen that erases the experiences of Black, Latino, and Asian teenagers. 
- This source's "wholesome" world of school papers and dances stands in stark contrast to the reality for Black teenagers of the same era, who were risking their lives to desegregate schools in Little Rock.

This document perfectly captures the dominant, commercialized, and racially segregated image of teen life that defined 1950s pop culture, while simultaneously ignoring the era's deep social and political conflicts.
