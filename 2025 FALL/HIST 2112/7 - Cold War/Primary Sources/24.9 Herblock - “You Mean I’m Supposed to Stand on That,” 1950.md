Editorial cartoonist Herbert Lawrence Block, who wrote under the name “Herblock,” was a fierce critic of McCarthy — both the man and the movement — and c**oined the term McCarthyism** on March 29, 1950, **weeks after Senator McCarthy’s first anti-Communist speech in Wheeling**, West Virginia. The following cartoon, published in the Washington Post, shows four prominent Republican senators, Robert Taft, Styles Bridges, Kenneth Wherry, and George Gabrielson, **pushing the Republican Party behind McCarthy.**

The cartoon depicts McCarthy as a desperate figure, precariously balanced on a stack of tar barrels—one of which is labeled "McCarthyism"—being pushed toward a teetering platform atop an elephant (the symbol of the Republican Party).

- **Key Symbols:**
    
    - **The Elephant (GOP):** The Republican Party is shown as a nervous and reluctant vehicle, clearly unstable and unsure about this path.
        
    - **The Four Senators:** These prominent Republicans are the ones actively pushing this dangerous gamble, trying to elevate McCarthy to win elections.
        
    - **The Tar Barrels:** Tar is a key material in "tar and feathering," a historical form of vigilante justice and public humiliation. By balancing on "McCarthyism" tar barrels, Herblock shows that McCarthy's entire platform is built on **smear tactics** and baseless accusations.
        
    - **The Caption:** The elephant's line, "You Mean I'm Supposed to Stand on That?," captures the party's own fearful recognition that this platform is unstable, immoral, and likely to collapse.
