In 1957 nine black teenagers attempted to desegregate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, pursuant to a federal court order. This *photograph captures fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, surrounded by an angry white crowd on the first day of school.* **The photo also shows an enraged white student, Hazel Bryan, shouting at her to go home. Neither Eckford nor the other black students managed to attend school that day, but they entered Central High after President Eisenhower sent in federal troops to protect them.**

- This photograph of Elizabeth Eckford provides the starkest possible contrast to the pop-culture image of the 1950s teenager. It is the most powerful source in this chapter for analyzing the theme of **Who Is an American?**

#### A Battle for Basic Citizenship

While white teenagers (like those in Dick Clark's book or Charlotte Jones's letter) were defining their new cultural and economic power, this source shows that Black teenagers were fighting for their most basic constitutional rights.

- Elizabeth Eckford, a fifteen-year-old, is not concerned with "date bait" or Elvis. She is attempting to exercise her right to an equal education as defined by a federal court order.
    
- The "angry white crowd," which includes another teenager (Hazel Bryan), is violently enforcing a racial definition of who is "American" enough to attend Central High. They are screaming that Eckford is not the "right fit" for their society.

#### A Clash Over the Role of Government

This source is also a perfect illustration of the **Role of Government** theme. It shows all three branches of the federal government in a direct confrontation with state and local power.

- **Judicial Power:** A federal court ordered the school's desegregation.
    
- **Executive Power:** When local authorities and the "angry white crowd" prevented the students from entering, President Eisenhower had to send in **federal troops** to enforce the law.
    

- This image shatters the "poodle skirt" and "malt shop" nostalgia of the 1950s. It proves that while white teens were becoming a new consumer market, Black teens were on the front lines of a war to secure their fundamental citizenship, facing down mob violence just to go to school.
