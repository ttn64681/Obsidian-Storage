**Important for exam ON IT FOR SURE**

# Franklin Delano Roosevelt - American Savior, American Satan?
Most important president of the 20th century.
- him and his Cabinet (the New Dealers) lead the way through the Depression
- overwhelmingly popular
- **"liberal" but not left**
	- idea that the federal government can and should fix things
	- not revolutionary, believes that a powerful government (regulations) is needed to enact reform
	- government is a useful tool for change
	- similar to progressives who believed in reliable government and scientific views
	- the return of progressive reform
	- Hoover was not comfortable with this, and this reflected in his term

- 1933 
	- "The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself" uttered in famous inaugural speech

- Polio -> paralyzed in legs
	- spent time in hot springs in west Georgia
# Hoover and the Depression - the laissez-faire approach
Worst year of the depression was 1932, 3 years after Black Tuesday
- unemployment rate was 25%, additional 25% were underemployed (could not work the entire week)
- high suicide rate
- entire workforce can't work
	- automobile factories such as Ford halted production 
		- no workers, no buyers
- stock market loss 90% of its value

- Hoover's campaign motto was "Prosperity is just around the corner"
-  highly qualified, but wholly inadequate to the Greet Depression crisis
	- mechanical education
	- highly educated
	- progressive
	- worked during WWI to provide food relief for troops behind German lines
	- Secretary of Commerce
- firmly believed that proper response to economic depressions was to do nothing since it was natural
	- "not the role of the government to intervene in the economy"
	- staunch laissez-faire capitalist
- growing animosity towards Herbert Hoover
	- "hoovervilles"
## "Voluntary Cooperation"
- Hoover says not the role of the federal government to aid those suffering economically
	- help should come from private operations
		- churches, charity, local and state governments
- Hoover begs business to not layoff workers and cut pay
	- but with the state of the economy, that is impossible
## "Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) 1932"
Hoover finally realizes somethings need to be done, but in fact makes things worse 
- raises tariffs
	- countries would retaliate, placing tariffs on American goods
	- Americans lose foreign markets
- withdrew American funds from European banks
	- promptly caused German economy to collapse even harder

Hoover creates RFC
- gives low loans to businesses
	- idea that the infusion of money would get things moving again, and once the economy prosper the loans can be paid back
- involved in construction businesses
	- starts building infrastructure (airports, highways) because these projects employ lots of people 

Priming the old pump (Political Cartoon)
- pumps only worked when wet -> priming the pump met wetting it with external source first  (spend a little money to make more money)
- Hoover priming the pump with millions of money for public construction -> what comes out of the pump is employment and factories running
- Supposed to demonstrate how the program will be successful but they didn't go hard enough
## Too little, too late
### Bonus Army
Soldiers and veterans back in the day received payment for their service through land.
- WWI, many American men return and instead of land... the Bonus Bill says that 25 years form now (1945), veterans will be given a big payment
	- why wait until 1945? understand that at this time there is no social security
	- fear of starving in last years of life
	- to solve this, give money when they are old
	- however no one expected great depression to hit
	- war veterans suffering the same problems as everybody else
	- veterans demanded to receive their "Bonus" early instead of in 1945, so that they may spend it and get the economy running again
	- veterans don't receive money so they start organizing

"Washington or Bust in Bonus We Trust"
- veterans set up camps (hooverville style)
- clean, orderly, respectable 
- would sleep in front of congress, to hear vote of whether bonuses would be given out
- however it was always struck down in court
- start to become a political annoyance
- Hoover decides to get rid of them
	- US Army + DC police ordered to push the veterans out
	- Douglas McArthy put in charge of this (believed the Bonus Army were revolutionary communists)
		- he exceeded his orders and ordered his forces to physically throw them out
		- some veterans were killed
		- ordered camps to be burnt
	- Bonus Army is broken
	- Hoover essentially unleashed the army on veterans (bad pr)

Hoover only wins few northern states 
- owed to the fact that his Republican party was responsible for winning Civil War
- Roosevelt wins in a landslide
# The New Deal
Roosevelt wanted to be granted powers on the same level of those granted while at war to fix the economy.

Many of these programs were formulated by Roosevelt's cabinet. 
## Five agendas
### Relieve immediate suffering
- need to help the most desperate, not just because it was the right thing to do
	- but to prevent "unamerican" ideals from seeping into the populations
	- people who are desperate may be more willing to listen to extremist 
	- for political stability reasons

Federal Emergency relief A
### Save banks, increase money supply
- 
### Jumpstart industry
- need to get the factories working again
### Address the agricultural crisis
- need to take care of the summers
- Roosevelt felt that farmers were the heart and soul of America
### "make-work" programs to restore morale
- need to restore morale

# Part 2




## Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA)
One of the most important things it did 
- gave money to the poorest of the poor via a means test
	- provide financial records
	- its a work program, provide labor in exchange for the money

Harry Hopkins in charge of national fera program
- previously was head of fera in NYC, and then Roosevelt decided to expand it nationwide

This works but Americans don't like the idea of relying on others.
## The Banking Act of 1933
Context
- stock market has collapsed 
- if economy collapses -> people stop spending so demand drops and money stops flowing around
- what if you owe a bank money? -> the odds of paying them back are low with the state of the economy (no money)
- if all bank customers can't pay their loans -> bank depends on customers paying back their loans -> banks in a predicament
- knowing the economic situation, bank would not dare loan money but if they did theyd do so with super high interest
	- essentially impossible to get a loan
- banks start going bankrupt
	- knowing that you could lose your money in a bank if it goes bankrupt, people go on "bankruns"
	- rush to the bank to withdraw their money
	- what happens if people all pull their money out of a bank? well a bank collapses and becomes bankrupt!!
	- negative cycle
- how to get money moving again?
- how to get people to have faith in the banking system again?

Bank shutdown
- holiday where banks are shutdown and civil service employees sent to examine the health of the banks
- safe banks made public "okay to put money in here"
### FDIC and "Glass-steagall"
Federal Deposit Insurance
- pay a small fee to the bank
- the bank uses that fee to buy insurance from the government -> insurance covers your bank account up to 10,000 (now up to 250,000 today)
- if the bank goes bankrupt, you dont lose your money!

Creating confidence in the system

Glass-steagall Act
- puts a wall between commercial and investment banking
- can't use someones account to invest in stock market
## National Recovery Administration (NRA)
- idea is to get the factories working again

Context
- workers and owners have been fighting for decades (unions, strikes, etc.)
- last thing we want in the midst of a depression are fights over working conditions and wages
- we don't want businesses competing with each other in a cut throat manner

NRA designed to create harmony
- 3 members of the club
	- labor unions
	- business owners
	- government
- Going to all agree on what fair wages are in an industry, prices
## Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)
Roosevelt had a soft spot for farmers and government spent a lot of money to support farmers.

Dealing with overproduction
- pays farmers not to farm
	- e.g., take 1/3 of your acreage out of production in return for cash
- now with 1/3 out of production, prices of agricultural products go up
	- however if you weren't a farmer, why would you want prices of food to go up!?
	- helps farmers but doesn't help consumers -> there is pushback

Great example of how some new deal programs made racial problems even worse
- new deal was not a civil rights program
- federal government relies on cooperation of state and local governments
- in the South, state and local governments are staunch segregationists 
- new deal never challenges racial hierarchy
- AAA gets executed in a racist way
	- sharecroppers not given money 
	- every 1/3 sharecropper gets fired
	- remember sharecroppers are majority black
	- many black people now out of work
	- Roosevelt doesn't challenge this because he doesn't want to lose the support of the South
## "Make-work" Programs
Americans don't like charity because it makes them feel like they failed.

Biggest insight that government realized that they need to make the people feel valuable and like theyre doing their part -> set up make work programs.

Fills pockets of Americans and makes them feel better because its done so through work.
### Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
 - did environmental work
	 - reforestation
	 - fire suppression
	 - built trails, camp sites, and state parks
	 - $25 a month, keep 5 and send 20 home
- all men
	- did hire black men, but with segregation
### Public Works Administration (PWA)
- builds big stuff
	- dams
	- employs lots of people, construction companies, and psychologically cool to work on dams
### Works Progress Administration (WPA)
FERA becomes WPA
- well over 8 million people for for WPA
- many many jobs
	- build an airport, stadium, airport
	- soil erosion control, dig ditches
	- artists painted many WPA murals depicting work
### Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
- dams just for the south
- employ people and bring electricity to those in the Appalachian mountains
# Other Important New Deal Programs
## Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)
watch dog for stock market
## Social Security Act
fear of running out of money when old -> plan to address that
## Wagner Act of 1935 and the NLRB
guarantees worker's right to unionize
- one that YOU form, not one your employer forms
# Backlash against the New Deal
gets criticism form political left and right
## conservative businessmen - new Deal too radical
- like hoover

1. believes government doesn't have the right to do these things -> usurpation of power (and even if they did have the right i doesnt work)
2. if not careful, it could be a trojan horse for tyranny

- people found it menacing when Roosevelt expanded supreme court so that they would stop striking down his deals (court packing)
## radicals - new deal too conservative
- roosevelt trying to save capitalism but radical believe capitalism is bad!
- roosevelt is a rich guy we cant trust him!!
- believes they need a communist government

## others - a mix of criticism
### Townsend Clubs
### Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin
Huey Long socialist 

Charles Coughlin neo-nazi

Both alteratnives to Roosevelt
