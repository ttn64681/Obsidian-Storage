**In 1936 President Roosevelt established the Great Plains Committee to <span style="background:#fff88f">investigate the causes of the Dust Bowl</span> and <span style="background:#fff88f">possible solutions</span> for the region. The committee’s report, submitted the following year, outlined how federal, state, and local government agencies could work together to restore the Great Plains to economic health. One of the witnesses the committee called to testify was <font color="#ffff00">Otis Nation, an organizer for the Oklahoma Tenant Farmers’ Union, whose testimony follows.</font>**

<span style="background:#fff88f">- He argues that the drought was not the root cause but the **final straw** that broke an already exploitative and unsustainable economic system.</span>

- *His testimony is crucial because it reframes the "Okie" migration not as a natural disaster, but as the result of a man-made economic system that was squeezing small farmers off their land long before the dust storms began.*

1. High interest rates.
2. The tenant and sharecropping system.
3. Land exhaustion, droughts, soil erosion, and the one-crop system of farming. 
4. Unstable markets.
5. Tractor farming.


- **Predatory Debt:** Farmers were trapped by high interest rates, causing a downward spiral from ownership to tenancy, to sharecropping, and finally to migration.
    
- **Exploitative Sharecropping System:** Landlords charged tenants and sharecroppers such high percentages of their crops (from 33% to 75%) that it was impossible to get ahead.
    
- **Environmental Destruction Driven by Economics:** The sharecropping system is "chiefly responsible for the one-crop system". Landlords forced tenants to plant cash crops like cotton, which exhausted the soil and prevented conservation practices, directly contributing to the Dust Bowl. Hampered crop-diversification
    
- **Market Speculation:** Farmers were powerless against speculators who set prices low at harvest time and high when farmers had nothing to sell.
    
- **Mechanization ("Tractor Farming"):** Nation gives a stark example of <span style="background:#fff88f">one landowner buying three tractors and forcing 31 of his 34 tenant families off the land</span>, turning them into displaced migrants.


## 1. Challenges Faced by Women like Ann Marie Low (Source 22.6)
- Dust Bowl invaded the home,
- turning her primary responsibilities—<span style="background:#fff88f">cooking, cleaning, and maintaining a household—into a relentless and exhausting battle.</span> The dirt lay "inches deep on everything," and she noted, "We just couldn’t do anything until something was washed first," highlighting the Sisyphean nature of her work.
## 2. Evaluating John P. Davis's Arguments (Source 22.7)
John P. Davis's argument that the New Deal's AAA was detrimental to Black farmers is strongly supported by his evidence. 
He shows that the AAA's policy of paying landowners to reduce cultivation led directly to the eviction of hundreds of thousands of Black tenants and sharecroppers. Furthermore, he details <span style="background:#fff88f">"wholesale fraud"</span>  where landowners stole government checks meant for tenants and highlights the federal government's complicity, as it ignored complaints from Black farmers, effectively trapping them in an oppressive system.
## 4 . Mexican Unions' Assumptions vs. Davis's Reality
- Both Davis and Torres reveal the same tragic disconnect: 
- they believed **New Deal programs were designed to protect vulnerable people**, but both discovered that, **in practice, the federal government failed to stop local, racially-motivated violence and exploitation against minority groups.**

## How Low and Davis Might Respond to the Great Plains Committee Report (Source 22.10)
- **Ann Marie Low** would likely have found Otis Nation's testimony deeply validating. His description of "land exhaustion, droughts, soil erosion" would perfectly match her lived experience of battling constant dust storms. She would recognize her family's struggle in his diagnosis of the environmental crisis.
- **John P. Davis** would strongly agree with Nation's condemnation of the "tenant and sharecropping system" as a "robbing practice". This aligns perfectly with his own account of how that system was used to defraud Black farmers under the AAA. However, Davis would likely add that Nation's economic analysis was incomplete without a specific focus on how racism intensified this exploitation for African Americans.


## How the New Deal Changed Agriculture and Its Effects on Poor vs. Wealthy Farmers

The New Deal fundamentally changed American agriculture by ushering in an era of massive federal intervention. For the first time, the government actively managed the agricultural economy through programs like the **Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)**, which controlled prices by paying farmers to reduce production, and the **Soil Conservation Service**, which promoted sustainable farming.

However, the effects of these changes were vastly different for wealthy and poor farmers.

- **Wealthy Farmers and Landowners:** They were the primary beneficiaries. They received direct government payments to leave land fallow, which stabilized their income and protected them from market fluctuations. The New Deal also supported mechanization ("tractor farming"), which allowed them to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.
    
- **Poor Farmers (Tenants, Sharecroppers, Minorities):** They often suffered. The AAA's acreage reduction program led directly to the eviction of countless tenants and sharecroppers, especially African Americans in the South. The rise of tractor farming made their labor obsolete, pushing them off the land and into migrant work. And as the protest from Mexican workers shows, they were often excluded from the New Deal's new protections and left to face violent suppression.

Ultimately, the New Deal accelerated the consolidation of American agriculture into a more industrialized system, benefiting wealthier, land-owning farmers while often displacing the poorest and most vulnerable.
