Hiroshima | August 6, 1945

**In this photograph, a survivor stands among the ruins of Hiroshima. The bomb that was dropped on the city destroyed 5 square miles and killed 70,000 to 80,000 people. Three days later, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki.**

- 23.6 was the moral debate
- 23.7 was the political justification
- this shows the human result

- **From Progressivism to Annihilation:**
	- Harvey Wiley used science and government to create the Pure Food and Drug Act, saving lives by regulating industry
	- **New Deal** used massive government programs like the TVA to build dams and bring electricity to the poor
	- <span style="background:#fff88f">World War II took this power to its absolute peak with the Manhattan Project.</span>
- the result of a strong and scientific govt

- **The Brutal Reality of "Atomic Diplomacy"**
	- The Human Cost of Superpower Status:

- **Challenging the Dehumanization of War**
	- before was "Anti-Japanese prejudice in WW2"
	- **Re-Humanizing the "Enemy":** Wartime propaganda, on both sides, works by dehumanizing the enemy, making them easier to kill. The Japanese were often depicted in racist caricatures as sub-human. This photograph shatters that propaganda.
