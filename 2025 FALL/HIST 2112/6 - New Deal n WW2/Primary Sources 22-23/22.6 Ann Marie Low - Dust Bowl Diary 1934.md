**When massive dust storms swept through the Midwest beginning in the early 1930s, they blew away the topsoil of a once productive farm region and <font color="#ffff00">created hazardous living conditions. </font>
Residents needed to <font color="#ffff00">clean and wash repetitively</font> to perform even simple daily tasks. 
Ann Marie Low, a young woman living with her family in southeastern North Dakota, describes the difficulty of life in the Dust Bowl.**

- so much air you couldn't see
- even haze in the house
- "We joked about how hard it is to get cleaned up enough to go anywhere."
- "experts in Chicago estimated 12,000,000 tons of Plains soil was dumped on that city"

## The Human Face of Environmental Collapse
- The dust is not just a nuisance; <span style="background:#fff88f">it's an invader that makes basic existence nearly impossible</span>. Low describes dirt lying "inches deep on everything," turning every towel and curtain black.

## The Unseen Labor of Women
- men working out in the haze to farm
- women inside the house constantly cleaning

## ## Making the Case for the New Deal

	- **Soil Conservation Service**
		- Teaching new farming techniques across an entire region
	- Expansion of Government reach and power => necessary for survival
