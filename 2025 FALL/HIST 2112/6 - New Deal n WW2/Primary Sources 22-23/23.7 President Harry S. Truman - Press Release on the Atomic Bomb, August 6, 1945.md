**After the first atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy,” was dropped on Hiroshima,** President Truman released the following statement to the public. In it, Truman explains the development of the bomb, its destructive power, and **why it was used against Japan**. This *statement was made before the second bomb* was dropped on Nagasaki and before Japan’s surrender.

- Press release: "orthodox" justification
- *The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold. And the end is not yet.* 

- **"necessary and just act of military strategy and retaliation"**

- **VENGEANCE**: Retaliation for Pearl Harbor: Japan started this war, America will end it
- **A Final Warning:** The statement is also an ultimatum. Truman references the **Potsdam ultimatum** of July 26, which Japanese leaders had rejected.
	- This was met with Little Boy 

**Truman's statement is confident, aggressive, and devoid of moral doubt.**
