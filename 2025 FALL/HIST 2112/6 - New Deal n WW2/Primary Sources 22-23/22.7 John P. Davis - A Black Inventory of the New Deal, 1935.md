**African Americans shouldered a double burden during the Great Depression. Already victims of racial oppression, they now fell into even deeper poverty while still experiencing discrimination. Although the New Deal tried to help farmers through the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, which paid farmers to cut back production and cease farming parcels of land, it did little to improve the fortunes of black tenant farmers and sharecroppers, who were often forced off their plots to reduce production. <font color="#4f81bd">In this excerpt from an article in the NAACP‚Äôs Crisis , John P.

### The New Deal as a Weapon Against Black Farmers

Davis argues that the **Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)**, instead of providing relief, has actively **"enforced poverty on the Negro farm population"**.

- **Mass Evictions and Unemployment:** The core of the AAA was paying landowners to reduce crop production. The direct result was that landowners, though contractually forbidden from doing so, **fired hundreds of thousands of Black tenants and sharecroppers** because they were no longer needed. Davis cites a government estimate of a quarter-million agricultural jobs lost in 1934 alone, the majority being *"unskilled Negro agricultural workers".*
    
- **Yt ppl Stealing Parity Checks for Black Tenants:** For the Black tenants who remained, landowners committed **"Wholesale fraud"** by stealing the government "parity checks" that were supposed to go to them.
    
- **Government Complicity:** Davis makes it clear that the federal government was complicit in this oppression. When Black tenants wrote to the Department of Agriculture in Washington to complain, their <span style="background:#fff88f">letters were simply sent "back to the locality in which they live,"</span> where they faced retaliation. The system made it impossible for them to enforce their rights, leaving them in a state of **"root hog or die"**. üò≠üôèüíî
