**Describe the challenges faced by rural Americans in the 1930s and explain the responses made by different individuals and groups to those problems.**

**directly addresses the era's biggest themes:**
- the unprecedented <span style="background:#40a9ff">expansion of the federal government's role in daily life</span>
- and the question of <span style="background:#40a9ff">who was included—and excluded—from that new American safety net.</span>

## Questions:
- **What is the proper role of the federal government?** Both Progressivism and the New Deal answered with "a bigger one," but the results were complex.
	-  The "Good": A Tool for Reform and Relief
		- The expansion of government was a direct response to the "industrial chaos" and social misery of the Gilded Age.
	- The "Bad": A Tool for Control and Exclusion
- **Who is an "American" worthy of this new protection?**
	- **Progressives** had a dark side. Their desire for a scientifically managed society led directly to the pseudo-scientific movement of **eugenics**, which resulted in forced sterilization laws targeting "criminals" and the mentally ill.
	- The push for women's suffrage was sometimes fueled by racism, with activists like Belle Kearney arguing for the vote as a way to ensure "White Supremacy"
	- Settlement houses, while providing aid, also pushed a paternalistic agenda of forced assimilation on immigrants.

# The Challenges: A Perfect Storm of Disasters
- Rural American Lives' were devastated by Twin Disasters:
	- Great Depression
	- Great Plains Drought (Dust Bowl)

- Rural American Lives' before were already bad:
	- Sharecropping hampered crop-diversification; left many AA's exploited by white farmers
	- farmers had spent decades **overgrazing pastures** and **exhausting the soil** through **overproduction**
		- Prices dropped dramatically throughout the 1920s, and farmers were the only group whose incomes fell during that decade.

- **Great Depression effect:**
	- many farmers did not have resources to stay on their land
		- *farm foreclosures* tripled in the early 1930s.
- **Drought effect:**
	- Ferocious dust storms plagued many of the farmers who desperately struggled to hold on to their land

# The Responses: Migration, Hostility, and Government Intervention
## Migration
- Sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and former farm owners left their homes to find better opportunities, and <span style="background:#fff88f">a million people left the Great Plains alone </span>
## Hostility
- TOO MANY West Coast Refugees that California passed a law preventing poor people from coming over as a non-state resident

- **Government response:**
- <font color="#ffc000">New Deal:</font>
	- <font color="#ffc000"> the first time the federal government intervened on such a massive scale to directly manage the agricultural economy and the lives of farmers.</font>
	- **Agricultural Adjustment Act** attempted to raise crop prices and stabilize agricultural incomes by encouraging farmers to cut production. (most radical program)
		- did very little to help
		- <span style="background:#ff4d4f">	horrible for black sharecroppers</span>
			- when a white landowner was paid to take a field out of production, he often just fired the Black family farming it.
	- **Farm Credit Act** helped some farmers refinance mortgages at a lower rate
	- **Rural Electrification Administration** brought electricity to farm areas previously without it
	- **Soil Conservation Service** advised farmers on how to properly cultivate their hillsides
	- The report of the **Great Plains Committee** (Source 22.10), another Roosevelt creation, *detailed additional recommendations for helping the agricultural economy in the Midwest.*

## Exclusion and Deportation:
- <span style="background:#fff88f">In contrast, the federal government failed to protect Mexican migrant workers and instead deported a large number of them to Mexico</span>
- regardless of their citizenship status.
