## PS
**Father Johannes Siemes, a German priest living in Japan, wrote the following eyewitness account of the Hiroshima bombing. Siemes lived less than a mile outside the city, and after the attack he went into Hiroshima to look for other priests from his order. He gave this account to Bishop Franklin Corley, an American soldier and one of the first Americans to enter the city.**

- ground-level, human perspective on the bombing
- shifting the focus from high-level strategy to the immediate and horrifying consequences for civilians. 
- It's powerful because of its calm, detailed description of a society completely breaking down.

- **The Collapse of Infrastructure:** notes it took over **thirty hours for the first official rescue party to arrive** because "the whole city had been knocked out at a blow" and all emergency preparations were lost. This demonstrates a new kind of warfare that doesn't just defeat an army but obliterates the very fabric of a city.
    
- **The Unseen Killer—<font color="#ff0000">**Radiation**</font>:** This is a crucial aspect of his account. Siemes describes people with "small external wounds" who died weeks later from an "inflammation of the pharynx and oral cavity". He also notes that two priests who were unburned became weak 14 days later, and their physician diagnosed it as **leucopenia** (a decrease in white blood cells). This was the world's first encounter with the terrifying, invisible, and delayed effects of radiation sickness, a horror unique to this new weapon.
    
- **Psychological Terror of Americans:** The account reveals the profound fear and confusion. When Father Siemes's group tried to help refugees, the survivors first wanted to know their nationality, fearing they "might be Americans who had parachuted in". This detail shows a population not just physically wounded, but psychologically shattered.

## Interpret the Evidence

**Compare the arguments of the scientists who opposed dropping the atomic bomb on Japan (Source 23.6) with those put forward by President Truman for dropping the bombs (Source 23.7).**
- Scientists: Their argument was rooted in **morality and foresight**. They felt the original reason for the bomb—fear of a Nazi weapon—was gone now that Germany was defeated. They urged a diplomatic approach
- Truman: His argument was based on **military necessity and retaliation**. He framed the bomb as a tool to "obliterate more rapidly and completely" Japan's ability to make war and as direct payback for Pearl Harbor.

**According to the strategic bombing survey, what role did the atomic bombs play in defeating Japan (Source 23.9)?**
- atomic bombs were **not the decisive factor in Japan's defeat**.
- survey found that the Emperor and other key leaders had already decided to surrender as early as **May 1945**
- atomic bomb's role was political
	- acted as a catalyst to overcome political stalemate

**How does what you see in the photograph of the day after the bombing of Hiroshima (Source 23.8) compare with the eyewitness account in Source 23.10? Which do you find more powerful and why?**
- **The Photograph (Source 23.8):** Its power lies in its **stark, immediate symbolism**. The image of a lone survivor amid total desolation communicates the scale of the physical destruction and the profound human isolation in an instant.
- **The Eyewitness Account (Source 23.10):** Its power is in its **narrative detail and creeping horror**. It describes not just the initial blast, but the agonizing aftermath: the lack of medical care, the slow deaths, and the mysterious, terrifying effects of radiation sickness.

**What evidence can you find in these documents that atomic power would play a critical role in shaping the postwar world?**
- The **scientists' petition** is the most direct, explicitly warning of a future where "rival powers" would create a "continuous danger of sudden annihilation".
- **Truman's press release** declares the bomb "ushers in a new era" and boasts that "even more powerful forms are in development," a clear message of American dominance aimed at the Soviet Union.    
- The **Strategic Bombing Survey** shows the bomb's power to act as a political tool, capable of breaking a political deadlock and shaping the end of a war.
- **Father Siemes's account** shows the new kind of fear this power creates, with rumors that the ruins emitted "deadly rays" and the central district would be "uninhabitable for some time to come".


Analyze the political, military, and racial motives behind the decision.
**Military Motive:** The public and official reason was to end the war quickly and avoid **Operation Downfall**, a planned land invasion of Japan that was projected to cause hundreds of thousands of American casualties.
**Political Motive:** Dropping the bomb was a powerful demonstration of American might intended to intimidate the Soviet Union and establish the United States as the dominant global superpower at the dawn of the Cold War.
**Racial Motive:** The war in the Pacific was fought with a unique racial viciousness. As mentioned in your "WWII" reading notes, **anti-Japanese prejudice** was rampant in the U.S.. Propaganda often depicted the Japanese as sub-human. This dehumanization likely made it easier to justify dropping a weapon of indiscriminate destruction on civilian cities, a decision that was not made in the war against Germany.


What were the alternatives to dropping the atomic bomb and why weren’t they used?
- U.S. wanted to project an image of absolute victory and was politically committed to "unconditional surrender."
