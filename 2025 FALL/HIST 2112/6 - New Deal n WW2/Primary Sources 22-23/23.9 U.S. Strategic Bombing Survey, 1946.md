**After the war, President Truman called for a series of surveys on the effectiveness of strategic bombing campaigns in Europe and Asia and on the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The survey on the Pacific war included interviews with Japanese military and government leaders as well as information from Japanese wartime documents.<span style="background:#fff88f"> It concluded that the use of the atomic bombs was unnecessary because even without them Japan would have surrendered in the fall of 1945.**</span>

- **Surrender was Inevitable:** The report states its "opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, <span style="background:#40a9ff">Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."</span>
- **The Bombs Weren't the Deciding Factor:** The survey explicitly says the bombs "did not defeat Japan"
- **True Factor was Conventional Bombing:** The report credits *"air supremacy and its exploitation over Japan proper"* **as the major factor** that made defeat inevitable and "obviated any need for invasion."


- **directly refutes President Truman's claim that the atomic bomb was the only alternative to a costly land invasion**

- **Truman's statement** *was a wartime press release designed to justify a controversial action* to the world. It simplified a complex situation for maximum public support.
