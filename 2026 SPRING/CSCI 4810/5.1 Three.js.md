# Intro - Three.js & WebGL
- moving to 3D graphics
- Three.js runs on WebGL - provides web buffers, shaders
- We can use matrix math for TRANSFORMATIONS (python)
- how do we trace the 3d perspective into 2d?
	- camera

# Geometry + Material = Mesh
## Material
- MeshBasicMaterial
- MeshNormalMaterial
- MeshStandardMaterial

##  The Big Three: Scene, Camera, Renderer
- **Scene**: Container that holds all your 3D objects, lights, etc.
- **Camera**: Defines the viewpoint - what you see and from where
- **Renderer**: Draws the scene to a \<canvas> element using WebGL

- orbit contorls



## Non-Module Approach (Script Tag)
- simplest way to get started: Include Three.ks w/ a regular script tag
1. download three.js (or three.mjs)
2. ```
   <script src="js/three.js"></script>
   <script>
   	// THREE is now a global var
   	const scene = new THREE.Scene();
   	// ...
   </script>
   ```
- Pros: simple, works from file system, works offline
- Cons: loads entire library even if you only need few features
	- Adds extras like (OrbitConsole)

## Your First0Cube
- to adda a visible object you need 2 things: a Geometry (shape) and a Material (surface appearance). Together they create a **Mesh.**

- for a cemera to actually take a visual picture, there needs to be **LIGHT**

 - MeshBasicMaterial
	 - Color - bland, will look 2D
- MeshNormalMaterial
	- great for debugging
	- looks at orthogonal of tangent direction, changing color depending on position of ecah material pixel?
- MeshStandardMaterial
	- Physically-based, realistic shading

```
<script src="js/three.js"></script>

<script>
// --- THE BIG THREE ---
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.01, 10
);
camera.position.z = 1; // move camera back so we can see the cube

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window, innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild®nderer.domElement);

// --- Create a Cube --- 
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.2,0.2,0.2);
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

// --- Animation Loop ---
function animate() {
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
	cube.rotation.x += 0.01; // Leftwards
	cube.rotation.y += 0.02; // Downwards faster
	renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate()
</script>


```
