# Scene Graph:
- Scene (root)
	- Mesh (floor)
	- AmbientLight
	- SpotLight
	- Group (robot)
		- Mesh (torso)
		- Mesh (head)
		- Mesh (left arm)
		- Mesh (right arm)

## How the Hierarchy Works:
- Every node stores its own local transformation (position, rotation, scale)
- Three.js computes each node's world matrix by multiplying all the matrices from root to that node
- When a parent moves, all its children move with it - automatically
- Children can still have their own independent local transforms on top of the inherited ones
