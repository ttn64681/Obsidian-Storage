# Intro
- pipeline from 3D scene and transformations
- Main transformations in 2D is translation, scaling, rotation

# f transforms x to f(x)
- Sets & Functions: Fundamental concepts
- **Transformations:** Change vals through functions
	- **Linear Transformation:** Preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication
		- *Preserves collinearity* & *distance ratios*
		- Uniform Scaling, Rotation
	- **Non-Linear Transformation**
		- *Translation*: Shifting all points by a constant vector
		- *Non-Uniform Scaling*

- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication:** Transforms position vectors
- **Matrix-Matrix Multiplication:** Combines transformations (e.g., rotate, then translate).
- Note: Matrices assume the origin stays fixed


## Affine & Non-Affine
- **Linear transformation**
	- Only involves scaling, rotating, reflecting, or shearing w/o any transformation. It always keeps the origin fixed. The form is T(v) = Av, where A is a matrix.

- **Affine Transformation**
	- A linear transformation combined w/ translation
	- Ex: 
		- T(v) = Av + b, where A is the matrix (linear) and B is the translation.
	- Properties: Preserves straight lines and parallelism, but not distances or angles.

- **Non-Affine Transformation**
	- Distorts lines and parallelism
	- Ex:
		- Perspective projection or non-linear transformations like T(x,y) = (x^2, y^2).

# What does it mean to be linear?
- maintains the structure:
	- Definition: A linear transformation (or a linear map) is a function f satisfies both:
	- 1. f(x+y)  = f(x) + f(y)        **Additivity** (operation of addition)
	- 2. f(ax)    = af(x)                  **Homogeneity** (operation of scalars)
	- Benefits:
		- cost-effective computation
		- Compositions remain linear
		- Uniform representation of transformation
	- Compositions of linear transformations are also linear
		- Uniform representation of transformations.
	- <span style="background:#fff88f">If function satisfies both Additivity & Homogeneity, it's a linear transformation</span>

- Visual: Imagine a GRID w/ evenly spaced gridlines
	- Apply the transformation we are evaluating to the grid

- transformations are represented in matrices, and linear operations on matrices are more computationally efficient than non-linear transformations

## Vector Basics
*   **Original Point (Vector `v`):**
    [ x ]
    [ y ]

*   **Scaling Matrix (`A`):**
    [ 2  0 ]
    [ 0  2 ]

*   **Transformed Point (Vector `v'` = `A * v`):**
    [ 2  0 ]    [ x ]     [ 2x + 0y ]    [ 2x ]
    [ 0  2 ] * [ y ] = [ 0x + 2y ] = [ 2y ]

## What can we do w/ Linear Transformations?
- So when linear, then...
- 'apply' order doesn't matter -
	- We can add vectors and then apply the function f
	- We can apply function f and then add resulting vectors
- Similar for scaling
- Similar for ...


# Vector & Transformation: Using a transformation Matrix
- In graphics, we use transformation matrices to perform transformations
- Ex:
	- Pick an arbitrary transformation matrix A
	- Generalizing Transforming (x,y,z) in 3D.
- We get A x ( for now let's generalize )
	- ( A times x )
- Note: we are now in 2D space after doing matrix multiplication, only 2 coordinates (2 features/cols)
- Our old vector would transform to:
	[1] 
	[3] = 
	[5]

## Linear Transformations can be represented by 2x2 Matrices
# Quiz:
- **scaling** and **addition** and **rotation** are *linear transformations*
	- order does not matter
- Order DOES matter for affine transformations (linear transformations + translations)
