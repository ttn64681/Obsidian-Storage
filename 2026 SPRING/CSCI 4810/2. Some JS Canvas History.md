## Anatomy of Web Page

<html>
	<body>
		
	</body>
</html>
```


## HTML5 History
- modern lang since 2014
- supports canvas
- supports video and audio

# **Canvas Mental Model** (important)
- immediate-mode drawing to a pixel buffer (the underlying memory representation of canvas)

- canvas is a bitmap (pixels), not a scene graph
- after you draw shape, canvas doesn't "remember" it
	- no real "memory", have to redraw it!!
- <span style="background:#fff88f">Animation = clear -> update state -> redraw every frame.</span>
- Structure matters: separate the
	- update() and
	- draw() functions

- commands
```
ctx.fillRect(20,20,80,40);
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(140,60,20,0,Math.PI*2);
ctx.stroke();
```
=> These drawing commands are rendered into this Pixel Buffer
- "pixel buffer" refers to a region of memory that stores the color data for each individual pixel displayed on the screen.

## What is a \<canvas>?
- a container (data structure) for hosting graphics
	- renders bitmap (=raster) images (defined by JS)
- rectangular area on HTML page
- Canvas has several methods for drawing:
	- javascriptAPI
