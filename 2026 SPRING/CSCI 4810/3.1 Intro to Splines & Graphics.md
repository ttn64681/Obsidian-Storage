# Intro
- Bezier Curves:
	- lineTo, bezierTo, curveTo

## Origin: Shipbuilding and Drafting

## Translating into Usable Math
- Smoothness
	- Drafting: A spline's smoothness comes from minimizing physical curvature
	- Computer Graphics: A spline's smoothness comes from choosing **smooth functions**
		- usually *low-order polynomials*
- Control
	- Drafting: Controlled by fixed pegs (ducks)
	- Computer Graphics: Controlled by user-specified control points

# Bezier Curves - Math Foundation
- **Interpolation**
	- Finds unknown values b/w 2 known data points (P0, P1) by assuming a straight-line relationship, essentially drawing a straight line b/w them and finding the point on that line
		- linear interpolation (lerp)
- A **spline** is a piece-wise polynomial curve defined by control points. key characteristics are:
	- control points - define/influence shape of curve
	- piecewise - 
	- smooth - maintains continuity (at least C0, often C1 or C2) at the joints

- Different degrees of Bezier curves (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic)
	- how smoothness and control are mathematically achieved

*Bezier curves are approximating splines curve doesn't pass thru interior points like interpolating splines*

## Linear Bezier 'Curve'
- A Bezier Curve w/ 2 Control Points
- Ex: Draw. Line Segment points P0 and P1
- Get the point in segment formed by line connecting P0 and P1 - via t
- **Linear interpolation**:
	- t for time
	- t varies from 0 to 1 (proportion)
	- L_0(t) = (1-t)P_0 + (t)P_1
	- t = 0 -> P_0
	- t = 1 -> P_1
	- L_0(t) for different t values = [0,1]

## Quadratic Bezier Curve
- Linear:
	- L_0(t) = (1-t)P_0 + (t)P_1
- Quadratic: (3 points):
	- L_1(t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2
	- Interpolate b/w L1 and L2
		- Q_o(t) = (1-t) L_0(t) + L_1(t)
- Rewrite:
	- Q_0(t) = (1-t)^2 P_0 + 2(1-t)t P_1 + t^2 P_2

## Cubic Bezier Curve
- Cubic: (4 points):
	- L_2(t) = (1-t)P_2 + tP_3
	- Q_1(t) = (1-t)L_1(t) + tL_2(t)
	- Interpolate b/w Q0 and Q1
		- C0(t) = (1-t) Q_0
