- Computer Vision:
	- Image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc.
- NLP (Natural Lan Processing)
- effective acceleration techniques of deep learning systems including GPU-based implementations (important for real-time)
- deep learning model compression techniques 
	- (e.g., pruning, 
		- reduce redundant/unnecessary neurons
	- quantization 
		- (instead of floating point, use smaller (like int) to represent numbers, to reduce model size))
		- limited resource systems/devices
		- e.g. chatgpt model uses by default 16bit (FP16) instead of 32bit to store and process numbers

- how to train and use your neural network

Use and Train:
- predict/infer if cat or dog in image

AI Model:
- diffusion model to generate images

## Grading
- 35%: 2-3 small projects/hw to build and train neural networks in python
- 20%: Midterm
- 10%: Attendance (Random)
- 35%: Final Project (Group)
	- find research paper (w/ github code)
	- read and present in class
	- then reproduce method but improve
		- e.g. image classification w/ 95% accuracy to 97%
		- e.g. use model compression technique to reduce model size to make it deployable on edge or mobile device
- 3%:

- A - 93
- 10% late penalty per day
- start early as possible, b/c setting up env takes time
- slides submitted before class starts
