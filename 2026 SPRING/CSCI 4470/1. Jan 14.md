# CH1
- first message sent b/w 2 computers: "LO"
## 1961-1972: Early packet-switching principles
- Cerf and Kahn's internetworking principles:
	- minimalism, autonomy - no internal changes required to interconnect networks
	- best-effort service model
	- stateless routing
	- decentralized control
		- no single server/person controlling packet switching
- define today's internet arch

## 1980-1990: new protocols
- 1983: Deployment of TCP/IP
- 1982: smtp email protocol defined
- 1983: DNS defined for name-to-IP-address translation
- 1985: ftp protocol defined
- 1988: tcp congestion control
- new national networks
- 100,000 hosts

1990, 2000s: commercialization, the Web, new apps
- early 1990s: ARPAnet decommissioned
- early 1990s: Web
	- hypertext
	- html, http
	- 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape
- late 1990s-2000s:
	- more killer apps: instant messaging, p2p file sharing
	- network security to forefront
	- est. 50 mil host, 100 mil+ users
	- backbone links running at Gbps

## 2005-present : scale, SDN, mobility, cloud
- aggressive deployment of broadband home access (10-100's Mbps)
- 2008: Software-defined Networking (SDN)
- enteprrises run their services in "cloud" (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure)
- rise of smartphones: more mobile than fixed devices on Internet (2017)


## The Internet: a "nuts and bolts" view
- Billions of connected computing devices:
	- hosts = end systems
	- running network apps at Internet's "edge"
		- edge: end systems (devices)
- Packet switches: forward packets ©unks of data)
	- routers, switches
- Communication links
	- fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	- transmission **rate**: bandwidth (bits per second)
		- *fibre* has highest bandwidth b/c 
- **Networks**:
	- collection of connected devices (hosts and packet switches) and communication links
	- organized to allow data exchange among devices

- Internet: "network of networks"
	- Interconnected ISPs
- protocols are everywhere
	- control sending, receiving of messages
	- e.g., HTTP (Web), streaming video, Zoom, TCP, IP, WiFi, 4/5G, Ethernet

- Internet standard
	- RFC: Request for Comments
	- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

## Internet: a "services" view
- Infrastructure that provides services to application: 
	- Web, streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e-commerce, social media, inter-connected appliances, ...
- provides programming interface to distributed apps:
	- "hooks" allowing sending/receiving apps to "connect" tp, use INternet transport service
	- provides service options, analogous to postal service

## Protocols for Standardized Communication
- TCP Handshake:
	- => TCP Connection request
	- <= resopnse
	- => GET <hhttp:d.,asf>
	- <= file

## Closer look at Internet Structure
- Network edge:
	- hosts
	- servers often in data centers

## Access networks, physical media:
Q: How to connect end systems to edge router?
- residual access nets
- institutional access networks (school, company)
- mobile access networks

## Access networks: cable-based access
- cable headend determines which home gets access
- it is able to choose specific home via specific frequencies it recognizes
	- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
- HFCL hybrid fiber coax
	- asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbps downstream transmission rate

## Wireless access networks
- Shared wireless access network connects end system to router
	- via base station aka "access point"

- Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
- Wide-area cellular access networks

## Access networks: enterprise networks
- companies, universities, etc.
- mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and router

## Access networks: data center networks
- high-bandwidth

Host: sends packets of data
- host sending function:
- packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L(bits)/R(bits/sec)

- Buffering happens because the **rate at which bits arrive** at a device (like a router or your computer) **temporarily exceeds the rate at which that device can process or transmit those bits** (its bandwidth or processing capacity).
	- Essentially, if data comes in faster than it can go out, the excess data is stored in a buffer until it can be processed or sent.

- Links: physical media
	- coaxial cable
	- Fiber optic cable:
		- light
		- high speed operation
		- low error rate
			- immune to interference

	- Wireless radio
		- signal carried in various "bands" in EM spectrum
		- no physical "wire"
		- broadcast, "half-duplex" (sender to receiver)
		- propagation environment effects:

## Network Core
- Mesh of interconnected routers.
- **Packet Switching:**
    - Hosts break application-layer messages into discrete packets.
    - Unlike circuit-switching (e.g., traditional telephone calls with dedicated, continuous streams), packet switching allows multiple users to share network resources simultaneously.
    - Each packet contains multiple layers of protocol information; intermediate devices process relevant layers, and the destination decodes all layers to reconstruct the original message.
    - Analogy: Similar to a postal service where many different letters (packets) share the same carriers and infrastructure, each finding its way to a unique address.
    - forwarding: moving packets from a router's input link to appropriate output link



## Physical Infrastructure
## Internet structure: a "network of networks"
Q: given millions of access of ISPs, how to connect them together?
- not each point connects to every other point (O(n^2))
A: Multiple Global ISPs:
	ISP A, ISP B, ISP C
	- Internet exchange points to connect the global ISPs

- Tier 1 ISPs (the global big blue ones)
