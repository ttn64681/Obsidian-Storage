# Intro
According to Mental Health in America, 20.78% of adults are experiencing a mental health illness, which is equivalent to over 50 million Americans.

**Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Define the common mental illnesses: anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and sleep.
2. Identify the risk factors and symptoms of each mental illness.
3. Understand the importance of how exercise can contribute to combatting each mental illness.

# 1 - Anxiety
excessive levels of anxiety can have a negative impact on your quality of life.

- Anxiety is characterized by a state of worry, apprehension, or tension that often occurs in the absence of real or obvious danger.
- Anxiety can be classified in three ways: acutely (state anxiety), chronically (trait anxiety), and anxiety disorders.

- State anxiety refers to an immediate psychological and physiological response to a perceived threat.
- Trait anxiety is a personality characteristic that refers to an individual’s propensity to perceive situations as threatening. Those with high trait anxiety are more likely to experience anxiety with greater intensity and frequency than those with low trait anxiety.

- One of the critical factors for a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is anxiety that impairs your ability to function in daily life. 
- Anxiety disorders include, 
	- generalized anxiety, 
	- social anxiety, 
	- separation anxiety, 
	- selective mutism, 
	- phobias, 
	- panic, and 
	- agoraphobia. 
- Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health issues. 
- Approximately 31% of females and 19% of males in the U.S will develop an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. 
- You or someone you know will likely develop an anxiety disorder during your lifetime.

**Development and Symptoms**

Like cardiovascular diseases or cancer, mental health disorders have both a biological basis and environmental risk factors. Anxiety disorders are much higher in females. Females are nearly twice as likely as males to develop an anxiety disorder. Genetic and biological factors contribute to an individual’s risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Individuals with a first degree relative with an anxiety disorder are at a greater risk of developing a disorder. Genetic factors contribute to the development of an anxiety disorder, anywhere from 20-46%. While having a gene related to anxiety does not guarantee that someone will develop anxiety, our genes respond to the environment.  Environmental factors such as low household income, parenting style, and exposure to trauma also contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. It is the interaction between an individual’s environment and genetic make-up that impacts their propensity towards an anxiety disorder.

General themes across all the disorders include (Symptoms):

- A heightened sense of worry or apprehension in response to stressful stimuli, or an interpretation of a neutral stimulus as threatening. 
- Excessive tension, elevated heart rate, an increase in respiration, sweating, gastrointestinal discomfort, or feelings of restlessness.
- Another key characteristic of anxiety is avoidance. People with anxiety disorders avoid situations, people, places, or even thoughts that induce anxiety.

**Exercise for Anxiety**

Exercise has been shown to decrease anxiety, both acutely (state anxiety) and chronically (trait anxiety). As well, exercise can lower an individual’s risk of developing an anxiety disorder2. Both ***aerobic and resistance exercises can decrease feelings of anxiety in healthy***, physically active individuals3,4. If just starting an exercise program, feelings of anxiety may initially increase immediately after exercise. However, over time as an exercise program continues, anxiety will be reduced. The largest reduction is generally observed twenty to thirty minutes after a single bout of exercise. Training studies show large reductions in trait anxiety and diagnostic anxiety symptoms within six weeks of starting an exercise program, with exercise programs of 12 weeks showing a continual decrease in anxiety symptoms.

**Exercise Recommendations**

Aerobic exercise lasting between 20 to 30 minutes at moderate to high intensity have the greatest benefit for anxiety symptoms4. If you are just starting an exercise program, starting at a lower intensity and slowly increasing can help you become accustomed to the physical and psychological effects of exercise. Resistance training two days a week has been shown to improve anxiety symptoms3. Resistance exercise focusing on the major muscle groups consisting of 2-3 sets of 8-10 repetitions has been shown to be just as effective as aerobic exercise of the same intensity.

Trying several different types of exercise classes and sports can assist in finding a mode of activity that will work best for you! It can take time to have the physiological changes occur, being patient and consistent with your exercise regime will likely produce the greatest benefit.

**Why Might Exercise Help?**

There are several theories about why exercise would help improve anxiety:

Distraction theory- This theory states that physical exercise improves psychological aspect due to the removal of the individual from stressful life events.

Cross stressor hypothesis- This hypothesis states that exercise is a physical “stressor” and over time the body will have biological improvements (e.g., low heart rate at rest, improved oxygen extraction in the tissue) that will carry over when psychological “stressor” occurs.

One possible mechanism by which exercise may improve anxiety is through improved fear extinction. Fear extinction is a decline in the fear condition response.  In humans, two weeks of moderate exercise prior to exposure therapy significantly improved anxiety symptoms compared to exposure therapy alone. 

Furthermore, this study also found significant increases in plasma brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is important for the health of neural tissue. Exercise training could plausibly act both through physiological changes in the brain, such as increased BDNF which could contribute to improved fear extinction, or through cognitive changes due to a new interpretation of the somatic symptoms.

Although one third of the U.S. population will develop an anxiety disorder, many individuals will not seek treatment. Many suffer in silence due to the stigma surrounding mental health treatment. As you have learning, there are biological factors which are strongly related to the development of anxiety disorders. Exercise may plausibly induce physiological changes which can improve anxiety. Early intervention is best and developing healthy coping skills to deal with anxiety can help in your mental health journey.
# 2 - Depression
**What is Depression?**

It is relatively common to experience transient feelings of sadness or depressed mood. During these states, normal activities of daily living can feel arduous and require more effort than usual. Individuals with a depression disorder deal with this feeling for prolonged periods of time. For an individual to be diagnosed with depression, they must experience symptoms for two weeks or greater.

Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. An estimated 17.3 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past 12 months, and 21% of females and 13% of males ages 15-54 will have a major depressive episode at some point in their lifetime.  Depression is often comorbid with other mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders.

**Risk Factors and Symptoms**

Like anxiety disorders, depression disorders have both genetic and environmental factors. Individuals with a first-degree relative with depression have a 2 to 3 times higher risk of developing depression.  Other risk factors include:

- Female
- Younger than 50
- Less education
- Low income or unemployed
- Unmarried
- Parent psychopathology
- Childhood adversities/trauma
- Presence of other mental disorders

Depression is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including overwhelming feelings of sadness, either a loss of or excessive appetite, sleep problems, fatigue or loss of energy, impaired concentration or indecisiveness, lost interest in activities and decreased sexual drive. Symptoms generally occur more days than not and last for at least two weeks.

In the previous chapter, we briefly discussed areas in the brain related to mental health. In this chapter, we will discuss the neurotransmitters related to depression. A neurotransmitter is a way in which areas in our brain communicate with other brain regions. As part of the communication, there must be a receptor for the neurotransmitter to bind. When considering neurotransmitters, the most discussed is serotonin.

Here is a basic overview of the function of neurotransmitters: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InNhDfDfl5c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InNhDfDfl5c).

**Exercise for Depression**

Only approximately 30% of individuals with depression seek treatment. The benefits of exercise for depression are the most studied and well established. Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of developing depression and has been found to be an important part of treatment for those with depressive disorders. Exercise training studies show clinically meaningful reduction in depression symptoms, as marked by a 50% reduction in symptoms or remission. In randomized control trials comparing exercise to pharmacological treatment, exercise was as effective as the standard medication.

However, it is important to note medication can drastically improve depression symptoms and you and your doctor should determine what course of treatment is the most effective to treat your depression. An exercise regime in conjunction with medication treatment may help to offset some of the side effects of antidepressants (e.g., weight gain, and sleep issues). Medications generally take 6-8 weeks before there is an improvement in symptoms of depression. Exercise may help to improve other symptoms of depression acutely such as sleep, appetite, and energy.

# 3. Stress

Stress is part of life. Everyone, at some point in their lifetime, will experience stress. Stress can be positive, or what is often termed eustress. When we feel like we have the resources and capabilities to overcome stress, it can help us grow and improve our sense of self-efficacy. However, when we are unable to overcome or meet the demands placed on us, this is considered “bad stress”, which can leave us feeling distressed and overwhelmed.

**What is Stress?**

Stress is broadly defined as an imbalance in physiological systems that triggers psychological and behavioral responses to restore equilibrium.

**Hans Selye**, an early researcher, proposed a **three-stage stress response model**. 
- The initial stage or “alarm reaction stage,” is where the individual reacts to a stressor with the fight-or-flight response. 
- The second stage is the “resistance stage,” in which the individual adapts to the stressor. During this stage, an attempt is made to re-establish the equilibrium, while focusing resources against the stressor. 
- If a stressor continues beyond the individual’s capacity to cope, resources can be exhausted, making it susceptible to diseases. This “exhaustion stage” is reached when the acquired adaptation or resistance is lost.

According to the American Psychological Association, 22 percent of individuals surveyed in 2011 reported experiencing extreme stress over the past 12 months6. Chronic stress elevates the risk for both diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, autoimmune, etc.) and mental health issues (e.g., depression, anxiety, etc.)7,8. It is important to check and evaluate how you are handling and managing stress. In the next section, we provide some helpful coping skills for stress. 

**Managing Stress**

It is essential to develop healthy coping skills for the management of stress early in life. Many of the skills you develop during your college experience will stay with you throughout your lifetime. Below is a list of ways that can help you cope with your hectic life.

**Avoid all or none, fatalistic, and catastrophic thinking**  
All or none thinking is characterized by viewing situations in extremes, or a binary manner. You are either perfect or a failure. This type of thinking might look like “I must get an A in this class, or this class was a waste of my time.”. A lack of autonomy describes fatalistic thinking; viewing things in your life as though they will happen due to fate or destiny regardless of the efforts you put forth.  Fatalistic thinking may look like “No matter how much I study, I am going to fail this test”. Finally, catastrophic thinking is demonstrated by ruminating about irrational, worst-case outcomes. “If I can’t study for my test this week, I will fail my test, then I won’t pass my class, and no medical school will accept me!” These thought patterns will only make you more stressed. Challenging these extreme thought patterns can help decrease self-inflicted stress.     

**Prioritize and be realistic with expectations**  
When expectations for ourselves and reality are incongruent, we are more likely to experience stress. It is important to have realistic expectations for your goals for the semester. Considering the time requirements of your classes, activities, and social engagements, what is possible for you to achieve? At the start of each semester, consider the most important goals for you to accomplish that semester.  Write your goals down in order of most to least important then write down how you expect to achieve those goals.  Look at your goals and expectations, are they feasible considering all the things going on in your life? Realistic expectations can help you succeed and decrease the likelihood of becoming burnt out.

**Time Management**  
Using some form of planner/calendar can help you keep track of upcoming deadlines for assignments and exams. Setting reminders in your phone or calendar to work on assignments or studying for upcoming exams enables you to stay on top of your academic requirements. Make sure to set aside time for yourself; scheduling self-care throughout the month can help you stay balanced.

**Avoid procrastination**  
Writing a daily or weekly list of things that need to be accomplished can help avoid putting off assignments until the last minute, which can increase your stress. Try to address every situation and when you can, just take it one step at a time.

**Get enough sleep  
**While it can be tempting to decrease the amount of sleep you get in order to have more time for studying, sleep deprivation may worsen stressful situations. Sleep is vital for consolidating information to memory. When limiting your sleep or pulling all-nighters, the time spent studying will be less effective. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at least seven or more hours of sleep per night. There will likely be nights when it is impossible to obtain at least 7 hours of sleep; when this occurs, try a short 20-minute nap the next day. Napping for less than 30 minutes can help improve your mood and cognitive function.

**Exercise regularly and eat healthily**  
Both exercise and a healthy balanced diet can help reduce stress levels by improving your mood and providing your body with the resources to thrive.

Remember, there are things outside of your control.  Throughout your life, there will be unexpected challenges that you face. Remember to have grace and compassion for yourself. It is vital to have a flexible mindset and to be realistic and acknowledge that you may not achieve everything within the intended time frame. Try to relax and have alternative plans just in case. Keep in mind the big picture; while the path may take different twists and turns, remember it’s okay to readjust your goals.

**Exercise for Stress**

Based on the definition used above, exercise can be a physical “stressor”. However, regular exercise can help decrease feelings of distress and improve feelings of well-being. First and foremost, find a mode of physical activity that you enjoy! Lighter intensity activities such as yoga, tai chi, and qui quang have been shown to decrease feelings of distress and incorporate mindful practice. Higher intensity activities will help improve your fitness level quickly. Set aside time for physical activity. If you are feeling overwhelmed by all the things going on, take 10-20 minutes and perform one of these two videos.

# 4 - Burnout

The previous chapter briefly discussed Seyles stages of stress. In this chapter, we will focus on the final stage of stress exhaustion, also known as burnout. 

**What is Burnout?**

Burnout can be due to either physical exhaustion or mental distress. It is generally catalyzed by prolonged stress, in situations where high demands are placed on the individual9. This syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment culminates in decreased effectiveness at school and work10. As the pressures of courses, internships, shadowing, and social activities add up, we can begin to feel exhausted. 

**Increased risk for experiencing burnout**

- You strongly identify with academics
- You lack balance between your school life and your personal life
- You have a high workload, including excessive course loads, multiple social obligations, unrealistic expectations
- You plan to go into a helping profession, such as health care, teaching, or caregiving
- You feel you have little or no control over your situation

**Symptoms**

- Feeling exhausted no matter how much sleep you get, resulting in fatigue and insomnia
- Lacking the motivation to attend classes or start assignments
- Lashing out at others and increased irritability due to frustration
- Lacking inspiration and creativity to bring to projects and class discussions
- Loss of confidence in academic abilities
- Incapability to meet important deadlines
- Increased pain and tension in your body that can manifest as headaches, sore muscle aches, or jaw tension
- Higher frequency of illness due to stress and exhaustion
- Inability to concentrate on schoolwork or lectures
- Feeling bored or uninterested in aspects of school or areas of leisure that you used to enjoy

**Coping with Burnout**

- **Evaluate your options.** If you feel exhausted by the end of the semester, the semester’s demands were too much. Discuss these specific concerns with your advisor. Maybe you can work together to change or shift your course work to allow time to focus on your well-being. Try to set goals for what must get done and what can wait. There is only so much that can be accomplished in a semester.
- **Seek support.** Whether you reach out to schoolmates, friends, or loved ones, discussing your struggles and talking with someone about the issues you are having can help. Feeling connected with friends and family is vital to overcoming stressful situations. Take advantage of counseling and psychiatric services (CAPS). CAPS is the counseling service located on campus, and they provide workshops and counseling to help students manage their stress.
- **Self-care.** It is important to set aside time for yourself each week. Try and focus on being present during this time, and make your self-care time free of worrying about your to-do list. Explore programs that can help with stress such as yoga, meditation, or tai chi.
- **Get some exercise.** As discussed previously, regular physical activity can help you to better deal with stress. It also provides an opportunity to distract ourselves from our stressors.
- **Get some sleep.** Sleep restores well-being and helps protect your health.
- **Mindfulness.** Mindfulness is the act of focusing on your breath flow and being intensely aware of what you’re sensing and feeling at every moment, without interpretation or judgment. In a job setting, this practice involves facing situations with openness and patience, and without judgment.

**Acknowledging and Handling Emotions**

A common symptom of burnout is irritability and heightened emotional response. It is important to recognize these feelings and use positive coping skills when they arise. Below are a few techniques to help when trying to respond to strong emotions.

**Meditation or Body Scanning**

A common form of relaxation is meditation. Meditation is a technique and practice where an individual uses their mind to concentrate on a particular object, thought, or activity in order to accomplish a state of mental clarity and emotional tranquility.

One type of meditation that is particularly helpful is performing a body scan meditation. This type of meditation can help us connect with our body and mind and evaluate how we are doing in a nonjudgmental manner. Try a short body scan meditation. [https://www.helpguide.org/meditations/body-scan-meditation.htm#:~:text=The%20body%20scan%20is%20one,is%20not%20the%20primary%20goal.](https://www.helpguide.org/meditations/body-scan-meditation.htm#:~:text=The%20body%20scan%20is%20one,is%20not%20the%20primary%20goal.)

**Breathing Technique**

Take a slow deep breath in, fill your rib cage to the fullest extent. Now slowly over six seconds let it out. Controlled breathing is a powerful type of meditation you can implement to help reduce stressful emotions and anxious feelings. Before you get started, try to keep these tips in mind:

- Be in a calm, quiet environment
- Sit comfortably with your back straight
- Breathe in through your nose
- Exhale through your mouth, pushing out as much air as you can
- Keep your mind focused on your breaths
- Your mind will wander, acknowledge those thoughts and then bring your focus back to your breath

**Positive Attitude and Flipping the Focus**

Our thoughts shape our attitudes, our attitudes impact our behaviors. If you want to change behaviors, you must first look at your thought patterns. Whether it is at the beginning of the year, middle of the month, or end of the day, you have the ability to evaluate and change your thought patterns. When situations arise throughout the day, do your thoughts automatically go to the worst-case scenario? Challenging negative thoughts and evaluating what response from you can improve the situation can have a significant impact on the way you handle and cope with stressful situations.

Think about a time you may have thought that your professor was trying to overwhelm you with readings, assignments, and tests. Recognize: that you are having negative thoughts. Identify: that you are feeling overwhelmed. Challenge: would a professor try to intentionally overwhelm their students?  Reframe: my professor is trying to help me learn, preparing me for the tests, and encouraging me to be successful in the future; this would be a positive attitude.

When we feel like things are overwhelming and out of control, it’s important to focus on what we can control. Focus on concrete action you can take whatever the size that can help to improve the situation. While we can’t control situations, we can control our responses and actions toward our circumstances.

Whether you have a positive attitude, negative attitude, or are somewhere in the middle, there is always room to improve. Watch this [short video by John Bosworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQZX0IwGBjQ), a Mental Health Counselor, who provides three key tips to developing a positive attitude towards life.

# 5 - Sleep
Sleep is vital for our overall health. Getting excessive or insufficient sleep is related to several diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, and dementia11-13. A good night’s sleep is important for mood and cognitive ability14. However, as we will discuss in this chapter, there is variability in the amount needed and preferred time of bed. We will also discuss practical tips for improving sleep and why exercise is vital for a good night’s sleep.

**Chronotype**

Have you ever met someone who is up until 3 am every night, or conversely someone who wakes up at 5 am every day? These individuals likely have different Chronotypes. Chronotype is the behavioral manifestation of underlying circadian rhythms that control an individual’s sleep/wake cycles. A person’s chronotype is the propensity for the individual to sleep at a particular time during a 24-hour period. When our work, classes, or social engagements require us to be in conflict with our chronotype, our sleep suffers.  Michael Breus, also called “The Sleep Doctor,” is a clinician and researcher who focuses on educating and solving sleep problems for people who are at odds with their chronotype.  Watch the video for an overview of the [four chronotypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY51Sfh55mg&t=41s). It includes helpful recommendations for each chronotype to improve sleep.

1. Dolphin
2. Lion
3. Bear
4. Wolf

Circadian rhythm- An internal 24 hours clock, which is responsible for your sleep/wake cycle.

Chronotype- An individual’s propensity to sleep at a particular time.

**Sleep Hygiene**

More than one-third of individuals report sleep problems at some point in their life. Sleep problems over 12 months range from 16.4% to 26% and are characterized by: difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep or early awakening.  While we can’t always control when we have to wake up for school or work, practicing good sleep hygiene can improve our sleep. 

Our behaviors throughout the day and before going to bed can have a tremendous impact on our sleep. Below we offer suggestions to help improve your sleep hygiene.

**What are the signs of poor sleep hygiene?**

On a given night, do you wake up multiple times, or are you excessively sleepy during the day?  Additionally, are you taking over 30 minutes to fall asleep once you try to sleep?  If you are having trouble sleeping or feeling fatigued, you may want to consider your sleep hygiene. Evaluating your sleep routine or developing a sleep routine and implementing changes in your environment can help cue your body for sleep. This can decrease the number of nights you spend tossing and turning.

**Exercise for Improved Sleep**

If you are struggling to fall asleep at night, starting an exercise routine may help you fall asleep quicker. Acute exercise regardless of when the exercise is performed improves the amount of time you sleep, decreases the time it takes to fall asleep, and improves the efficiency of sleep15. Individuals who regularly exercise show similar benefits to those observed in acute exercise. Regular exercisers also show considerable improvements in perceived sleep quality. Poor perceived sleep quality can often be a significant issue.

Exercising outside earlier in the day exposes you to natural light which is important in the regulation of the circadian rhythm. The sleep foundation recommends 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a week. This breaks down to around 30 minutes, five days a week. The timing of this activity can matter. Exercise raises body temperature and high body temperature can negatively impact sleep. It is important to ensure that if you’re doing intense exercise you have sufficient time to cool down prior to your desired sleep time. Lowering your house thermostat can aid in cooling off after an intense exercise close to bed.
