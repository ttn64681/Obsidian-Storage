# Intro
Fitness is a broad term that has different meanings to different people and can depend upon your goals. 
**Fitness is defined as set of attributes an individual possesses or achieves that enables them to function at optimal levels and is specific to activities perform**

**Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain the importance of a warm-up and cool-down.  
2. Identify the FITT Principle and describe each component.  
3. Define and explain the health-related and skill-related components of fitness.  
4. Explain the SMART approach and construct personal goals  
5. Design a workout plan that caters to your ability and needs and includes a SMART goal.

# 1 - The Importance of a Warm-Up & Cool-Down

**WARM UP**

Before participating in any form of physical activity it is essential you prepare your body. A warm-up routine is important for many reasons including:

- Increasing heart rate to prepare the body for exercise or physical activity
- Increasing the circulation of blood flow, which increases the delivery of oxygen to the working muscles
- Ensuring muscles are supple and pliable, improving flexibility
- Important as a form of mental preparation
- Reducing the risk of injuries

- side shuffle
- high knees
- butt kicks
- frankensteins
- calf stretch
- quad stretch
- skips
- a-skip

**COOL DOWN**

Additionally, after a workout it is important you take the time to cool-down. The cool-down period consists of gradually returning your body to its resting state. A good cool-down provides many benefits, including:

- Removing waste products, such as lactic acid, from the muscles and preventing cramp
- Reducing muscles soreness and stiffness
- Preventing blood pooling and recirculating blood back to the heart, muscles, and brain
- Preparing the body to for the next workout, whether that be the next day or in a week

Stretching is recommended during the cool down period, as it improves range of motion. There are two types of stretching you should consider:

- **Static Stretching** – involves holding a stretch which is comfortable but challenging for a period of 10-30 seconds.
- **Passive Stretching** – includes the use of an external force to achieve the stretch. This could be accomplished through a partner, stretching device, or a resistance band.

- arm stretches
- leg stretches
- seated stretches

# 2 - The FITT Principle
FITT principle will make your workouts more effective. The FITT principle is an acronym which stands for:

- **F**requency
- **I**ntensity
- **T**ime
- **T**ype

**FREQUENCY**

**Frequency** **refers to how often you exercise.** Frequency is also dependent upon the type of exercise you’re doing. For example, if you are targeting cardiorespiratory endurance at a moderate-intensity the frequency is 3-5 days, whereas vigorous intensity is 3 days. However, if you’re targeting muscular strength 2-3 times a week is recommended. Just remember to have a least one day off per week.

**INTENSITY**

**Intensity** **refers to how hard you exercise.**Intensity can be classified as either moderate or vigorous. There are two ways you can measure intensity: 
- (a) perceived level of exertion and 
- (b) heart rate. 
- Perceived level of exertion is how you feel while exercising, so it is a subjective measure.

[Level of Intensity](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/index.html)

Heart rate provides a more objective measure, and specifically you want to calculate your **target heart rate**. Click on the following link by the American Council on Exercise to determine your: [Target Heart Rate](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/tools-calculators/heart-rate-zone-calculator)

**TIME**

**Time** **is the duration of the exercise.**How long you exercise will differ depending on your level of fitness and the type of workout you’re doing. With regards to intensity, minimum recommendations for moderate exercises is 30 minutes 5 days a week and vigorous exercise is 20 minutes 3 days a week.

**TYPE**

**Type** **refers to the specific kind of exercise you do to achieve the goals you have set.**There are four major types of exercise you should know: aerobic, anaerobic, strength, and flexibility.

- **Aerobic exercise**- is a type of moderate intensity physical activity an individual can sustain for an extended period of time. Aerobic means in the presence of oxygen. For example, jogging, swimming, or cycling.
- **Anaerobic exercise**- is performed at such a high intensity, it is only done in short quick bursts. Anaerobic means without oxygen. For example, sprinting, power lifting, or a HITT workout.
- **Strength exercises**- are designed to improve both muscular strength and endurance. For example, weight training, resistance bands, and body weight exercises.
- **Flexibility exercises**- improve the range of motion of any given joint or series of joints. For example, stretching, yoga, and Pilates.

# 3 - Health-Related Components of Fitness

The five health-related components of fitness are important to perform at optimum levels during exercise or to be able to function efficiently on a daily basis.

# 5 - The Importance of Goal Setting

**The Importance of Goal Setting**

Goal setting can provide an individual with focus, increase their motivation, and overall be an effective way to ensure success. Goals may be set regarding the future, such as career-orientated goals or related to the present in terms of academics, health, and physical activity. Regardless of what your goals may be, it is important to understand the different types of goals, how to set goals, and how to stay motivated to achieve your goals.

**Understanding the Types of Goals**

Goals can be categorized based on their length and limit.

- **Short-term** – goals which typically take no more than a year to accomplish. These can often be building blocks to help achieve long-term goals.
- **Long-term** – goals which are set for the future. This may be over a year or several years. Examples of long-term goals often involve career, family, and overall lifestyle.
- **Rigid** – goals that are locked in place and time and cannot be changed.
- **Flexible** – goals that can be changed, shifted, or altered.

# 6 - SMART Goals

Setting goals which are realistic, clear and attainable is a difficult task. Therefore, it is important each goal follows the “SMART” approach. Specifically, a goal should be:

**S**pecific

**M**easurable

**A**chievable

**R**elevant

**T**ime-bound

**SPECIFIC**

Try and make your goal as detailed and concise as possible. When doing so, asking yourself the following questions will help you along the way:

- What do I want to achieve?
- When do I want to achieve this?
- Where will I achieve this goal?
- Who may help?
- Why do I want to achieve this goal?

**MEASURABLE**

Measuring and tracking your progress is important as it can help you to help maintain your motivation and know when you have reached your current goal so that a new goal can be set. For example, a goal of “I want to complete 30-60 mins of exercise for 3-5 days each week” is easily measured compared to “I want to exercise every day”.

**ACHIEVABLE**

Try and ensure your goal is realistic and possible. You want to try and not set a goal that you do not believe you can accomplish, otherwise, it will be difficult to stay focused. However, remember a goal can be flexible, meaning it can be changed or altered if need be. For example, a goal of “I want to exercise every day for four hours” may not be as attainable as “I want to exercise for 30-60 minutes a day.”

**RELEVANT**

Does this goal matter to you? This is the question you should ask yourself. If the goal is not pertinent and applicable to you, then you may have a harder time accomplishing the goal. However, a goal that is meaningful and aligns with your overall plan will be much more beneficial in the long run and increase motivation.

**TIME-BOUND**

It is important to have an intended date with which the goal will be accomplished. The result of having a certain time limit will improve your focus and help you stay on course to be successful. Also, having a time frame enables you to measure your progress to coincide with your intended deadline. For example, the goal of “I want to complete 30-60 minutes of exercise for 3-5 days each week” is good but you could also include “I want to complete 30-60 minutes of exercise for 3-5 days each week for the next 3 months.”

Look at the example below of how to set a “SMART” goal:

**S** – I want to be able to run a 5k.

**M** – I want to be able to run a 5k in 25 minutes.

**A** – I want to be able to run a 5k in 25 minutes. I will achieve this by running 1 mile twice a week in 7 minutes.

**R** – I want to be able to run a 5k in 25 minutes, so I can successfully complete the Athens Moonlight 5k Run.

**T** – I plan to be able to successfully run a 5k in 25 minutes by July 15th, 2022.

# 7 - Foreseeable Barriers

A **barrier is an obstacle which may hinder you from achieving your goals.** Unfortunately, at one point in time we may experience a specific barrier to achieving our goals or even just being physically active, so it is important we are aware of what they are, so we can then overcome them.

Identifying what could prevent you from reaching your goal will better prepare you to overcome these factors when they present themselves. For example, if you know there is not enough time in a day to get everything done after class or you are too exhausted to exercise at the end of the day, perhaps you should plan to workout first thing in the morning. This way, no matter what the day presents you with, you will get your workout in and achieve your goals. This is called being stronger than your excuses.

To find out what your barriers may be, click on the link below and take the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Barriers to Being Active Quiz. Upon completing the quiz, you will see different barriers such as:

- Limited time
- Lack of motivation
- Social influence

[CDC Road to Health Barriers Quiz](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/professional-info/pdfs/toolkits/road-to-health-barriers-activity-quiz-p.pdf)

Now that you know your barrier(s), it is essential you also know what some of the solutions are. The CDC also provides many solutions for overcoming your barriers such as:

- Planning ahead
- Invite family and friends to exercise with you
- Select activities requiring minimal time, equipment, and risk
