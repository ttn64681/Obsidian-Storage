# 1 - Rules
- Volleyball matches consist of either five sets or three sets, depending on the level of play.
    - Three set matches: two sets are played to 25 and the third set to 15. The winner is the first team to win two sets.
    - Five set matches: four sets are played to 25 and the fifth set to 15. The winner is the first team to win three sets.
- Each set must be won by two points.
- A team are allowed six players on the court at one time, three in the front row and three in the back.
- A team are allowed a maximum of three hits per side.
- A player may not hit the ball twice in succession.

- A ball is considered out if it hits the floor outside the boundary lines, an antennae, the referee stand, and the ceiling above a non-playable area.
- It is legal for a player to contact the ball with any part of the body.
# 2 - Serving
To be a **playable serve**, the player serving the ball must:

- Stand **behind the end line** anywhere on his/her side of the court (players do not have to stand in the back-right position)
- Contact the ball before stepping on or over the end line
- The ball must travel **over the net.** If the ball hits the net, goes over and still goes into the opponent’s court, it is a playable ball and is good. If the ball hits the net and comes back on the serving team’s court, it is not a legal serve and results in a point for the opponent.
- The ball must **land inside** the opponent’s court

**Underhand Serve**

An underhand serve is usually the easiest to learn. Using this serve, beginning players often have better control over where the ball will land and thus are able to target specific areas of the court. Additionally, an underhand is typically easier to return as well. To perform an underhand serve, the player:

- Stands with non-dominant foot in front
- Holds ball loosely at hip height in non-dominant hand
- Creates a fist with dominant hand and rotates arm so that the heel of the hand is facing up
- Extends dominant arm/serving arm backwards
- Swings arm forward and hits the ball off the non-dominant hand (like a golf tee)
- Follow through with the arm

**Overhand Serve**

An overhand serve has more speed and power than an underhand serve but is often harder to control (or target where it lands). Players should practice and try to use it since the return for the opponents will be more challenging. To perform a standing serve, the player:

- Steps forward with the foot opposite the serving hand
- Tosses the ball, 3-4 feet above your head.
- Creates a bow and arrow with serving arm
- Contacts ball with open palm
- Follows through and transfers weight from back to front

**Float Serve**

This is an overhand serve where you don’t put spin on the ball with your toss and hit it with a hard-open hand that stops (like a high five). This type of serve has a lot of movement on it (it wobbles and floats) and can be hard for your opponents to determine what it will do. To perform a float serve, the player:

- Steps forward with the foot opposite the serving hand
- Tosses the ball with no spin, 3-4 feet above your head.
- Creates a bow and arrow with serving arm
- Contacts ball with open palm, like an exaggerated high-five
- Follows through and transfers weight from back to front

**Jump Serve**

This serve requires a lot of practice. It is harder to master because it involves a good toss, jumping, and hitting the ball all at the same time. The benefit is that you are higher and farther in the court when contacting the ball; therefore, it drops very quickly after crossing the net and is likely to be the hardest type of serve to return. To perform a jump serve, the player:

- Stands two to three feet behind the serving line and steps forward with the foot opposite the serving hand
- Tosses the ball high in the air
- Steps with dominant foot then non-dominant and then jump
- Creates a bow and arrow and contacts ball in mid air
- Contacts ball with the heel of the palm and follows through

# 3 - Passing/Bumping
**Forearm Passing**

- The **first** ball that comes over the net should be passed to your setter to set up your offense.
- To perform a forearm pass, the player:
	- Is in an athletic stance
	- Hands ready
	- Fingers at 90
	- Thumbs together
	- Arms are fully extended
	- Contacts the ball with forearm and shrugs the shoulders (does not swing arms)

**Overhead Passing or Setting**

Setting is the **second** touch and should “set” up your offense for a hit or spike. For beginners, the person in the middle front will often act as the setter to eliminate confusion. The main idea for beginners is to set the ball _high and off the net_ so that the attackers have a chance to make their approach. The fundamentals of the set are very important. To perform a set, the player:

- Has elbows high and hands above head in the shape of a triangle
- Body is square
- Contacts the pull with finger pads and extends arms
- Gently push ball up and out (end with arms like superman)
- Uses legs as needed

**_Back set:_** when a player sets the ball to someone behind him/her. The player is facing one direction and instead of setting the ball forward, s/he pushes the ball behind and a hitter attacks the ball. This is used to throw off the opponents as they likely are ready to block the hitter in front of the setter. A back set allows the offense to take advantage and surprise their opponents. To perform a back set, the player:

- Has elbows high and hands above head in the shape of a triangle
- Body is square
- Leads with their eyes
- Contacts the pull with finger pads and extends arms
- Gently push ball up and out (end with arms like superman)
- Uses legs as needed

# 4 - Attacking & Blocking
## Attack

- A spike is typically the third touch by a team:
- *you cannot attack a serve*

To perform a spike, the player:

- Watches the flight of the ball
- Footwork:
    - right – left – right – left
    - Short – short – long – long
    - Slow – slow – fast
- Knees bent and both arms extended backwards
- Jump to contact the ball with hitting arm being in a bow and arrow
- Contact ball with palm of hand and flick/snap wrist downwards

_Now familiarize yourself with different kinds of attacks:_

1. **Regular spike-** Full on swing for a spike.
2. **Dink-** A light hit where the ball is hit lightly to an open spot on the court.
3. **Tip-** Where the hitter hits the ball barely over the block so it drops behind the blocker.
4. **Down the Line-** Where the ball is hit down a sideline.
5. **Cross Court-** Where the ball is hit across the court to the opposite sideline.
6. **Push-** The hitter pushes the ball with two hands to an open spot on the court or pushes the ball deep in the court or to a corner.
7. **Roll-** The hitter rolls their hand over the ball and it spins slowly and low over the net.

## Blocking
During a block, the player on defense at the net tries to jump up and prevent the spike from resulting in a point for the opponent’s team. The player will jump high and try to contact the ball so it is returned to the opponent’s court. _You cannot block a serve._ To perform a block, the player:

- Stands with feet shoulder width apart
- Is an arm’s length from the net
- Faces the target
- Jumps to block the ball with hands

**Covering the tip-** If a blocker goes up to block a ball, and the hitter decides to tip it over their outstretched hands, someone has to cover the area where they might tip the ball.  Usually this is the player playing short in the back row or the person behind the blocker at the net.


# 5 - Strategies
## Rotating:
- a team rotates **each time they gain the right to serve** after the opposing team previously served (this is called a "side out")

- Rotating and Subbing
- General Rotation:
	- 6 players - Clockwise
![[Volleyball Clockwise Rotation.png]]

- At elite levels, each player has specific skills
- liberos (defensive specialists)
- 

- passing = bumping

### Positioning
- Coaches will put players starting at certain positions to maximize their strengths
- Coaches will use substitution to account for certain players' weaknesses

### Offense Options:
- **6-2 Offense**: 6 attackers, while two are capable setters; 
	- setter in the back row runs the offense, while setter in the front row is attacking. 
	- This allows for **maximum variation on offense,** but requires *high team level of coordination*
- **4-2 Offense**: 4 attackers, while two are capable setters; 
	- setter in the front row runs the offense, setter in the back row plays defense. 
	- This allows for **increased ball control on the first contact**, but *eliminates an offensive weapon.*
- **5-1 Offense**: 5 attackers, 1 setter. 
	- **Advantage of one player to run the offense**

## Defense
- diff defensive strats that turn to offense quickly
- beginners should position themselves in W-formation for defense and to receive the serve
![[W Defense.png]]

- teams use diff types of defensive sets, but following principles should be kept in mind when playing defense:
	- Try to block attack (1st line of defense)
	- Someone cover tips
	- Ensure the court is covered and there are no open areas of the court
	- Hit the ball high enough for others to get under it
	- Go after every ball
	- Stay active and move your feet
	- Try to get the first ball that comes over the net to the area where your setter is located
	- Try to turn your defense into an offense (w/ a bump, set and spike)
