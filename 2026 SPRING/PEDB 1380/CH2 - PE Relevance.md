# Intro: Why take PE?
- ultimately to combat the obesity epidemic
- "…to promote lifelong physical activity and fitness for the enhancement of health and well-being."
- This chapter will provide you details concerning important factors that could influence one’s motivation to being active:

**Lesson Objectives**  
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  
1. Describe the impact physical activity can have on healthcare costs.  
2. Recognize the prevalence of obesity within the United States.  
3. Identify the health benefits of physical activity.  
4. Understand the purpose of this PEDB course is to graduate you from a lower level of physical activity to a Level 5.

# 1 - Cost
- insurance companies are increasingly adjusting their rates based on amount a person exercises
- 97% of participants choose to exercise to reduce their insurance premium

- why are insurance companies lowering premiums for those who are physically active?
- physical activity protects individuals against:
	- Chronic disease
	- Improves physical and mental health
	- Increases cognitive function
	- Leads to a better quality of life

- lack of physical activity leads to higher healthcare costs

- **Specifically, the Basic Physical Education Courses (PEDB courses) at UGA serve to develop and advance your understanding of the importance of physical activity as it relates to a healthy lifestyle and provide you with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to help you obtain or maintain a healthy lifestyle.**


# 2 - Obesity
- **an obese adult is one who has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.**

- **CDC statistics:**
	- The prevalence rate of obesity is **41.9%**, currently affecting **4 out of 10 Americans.**
	- The estimated medical cost of obesity was **$173 billion** in 2019, those individuals with obesity had an increased medical cost of **$1,861** more than those of normal weight.

- **U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) stats:**
	- It is projected by 2030, about **115 million** adults in the U.S. will be obese.
	- The annual coast of being obese is **$4,879** for women and **$2,646** for men

The CDC 2021 Adult Obesity Prevalence map below displays the overall self-reported obesity levels of adults in the U.S. Most notably:
- All states and territories had more than 20% of adults with obesity. 
- The South (36.3%) had the highest prevalence of obesity, followed by the Midwest (35.4%), the Northeast (29.9%), and the West (28.7%).

- According to a recent study by [Oregon State University](https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/physical-education-requirements-continue-decline-colleges-and-universities-osu-study-finds), only **32%** of colleges and universities in the US require some form of physical education course to graduate. 
- An interesting factor behind this decline is assuming most students learn basic physical education in their K-12 years. 
- However, this is not the case, with only **21%** of US children and youth aged 6-17 meeting the physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity every day.

# 3 - Health Benefits
- According to the HHS, among all adults aged 18 and over, only **24.2% met the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.**
- However, regular physical activity is important to promote lifelong health and can:
	- Reduce stress
	- Increase mental health and mood
	- Improve the quality of sleep
	- Reduce your risk of stroke and other chronic diseases (diabetes, arthritis, etc.)
	- Help you connect socially
	- Improve concentration
	- Improve academic achievement
	- Boost your overall quality of life

Additionally, as a student ask yourself these questions:

- Do you ever feel bogged down by your coursework?
- Do you ever feel so lethargic that the only way you feel you can gain energy is by resting and watching TV or reading?

Well if the answer is yes, while these may be appropriate at times, UGA researchers have actually found that 20-40 minutes of moderately intense aerobic exercise can boost feelings of energy.

# 4 - Engagement
- be **actively engaged and participate – on a regular and consistent basis**– in your PE course. Consistent engagement and participation ensures that you will develop the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills necessary to lead a healthy lifestyle.

**The ultimate purpose of this PEDB course is to graduate you from a lower level of physical activity to Level 5.** 

Read through the following levels below, and identify your current level.

- **LEVEL 1:** Student has no or minimal past experiences with physical activity
- **LEVEL 2:** Student cognitively understands what it takes to perform a physical activity properly, and begins to show signs of physically performing the activity correctly
- **LEVEL 3:** Student begins to make connections with practice at the classroom level and attempts to transfer his/her skills outside the classroom, while adhering to the rules and traditions of the activity
- **LEVEL 4:** Student sees activity as a social activity, which can be engaged in with friends, family, or coworkers for recreational purposes
- **LEVEL 5:** Student views activity as a medium to ultimately enhance their level of physical activity, providing an opportunity to impact others and sustain a healthy level of exercise for the duration of his/her life
