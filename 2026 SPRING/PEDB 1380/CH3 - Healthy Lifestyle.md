# 1 - Physical Wellness
**The physical component of wellness encourages the balance of regular physical activity, building healthy eating habits, and maintaining a healthy weight.**

**Regular Physical Activity**

- Physical activity is any voluntary body movement which burns calories.

- _The American Heart Association_ (AHA) recommends adults should perform:

	- Moderate-intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 30 minutes, 5 days a week. A total of 150 minutes.
	- Vigorous aerobic activity for a minimum of 25 minutes, 3 times per week. A total of 75 minutes.
	- Moderate-high intensity muscle strengthening activity at least twice per week.

**Healthy Eating Habits**

As a student, you live an on-the-go lifestyle with going to class, doing homework, studying for tests, and possibly a job. Therefore, it may be difficult to eat the right foods and make healthy decisions. However, in order for your body to perform everyday tasks, it needs to be given the necessary fuel.

The following tips can help you get started with developing healthy eating habits:

- Always eat a good breakfast
- Keep healthy snacks on hand
- Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day
- Make smart nutritional meal choices
- If you eat out, choose your food wisely

**Maintaining a Healthy Weight**

The final component of physical wellness is maintaining a healthy weight, which is achieved by a combination of regular physical activity and eating healthy. However, it is also important to understand what your ideal weight looks like and how to measure it.

One method to determine a healthy weight is by measuring your Body Mass Index. Below is a tool to help you calculate your BMI and longer-term weight goals. BMI is calculated using only your height and weight.

Keep in mind…

Since many of you are not growing anymore, BMI can be tricky. If you develop muscle and lose fat, you could still weigh more because muscle weighs more than fat. An increased weight, even if due to muscle, will increase your BMI. Thus, percent body fat becomes more important.

# 2 - 8 Dimensions of Wellness
This chapter will now continue to give you a brief overview of the remaining dimensions of wellness. Remember, each dimension of wellness is an important aspect of an individual’s life, however, you do not need to find a balance among them all. Instead, the goal is to focus on the specific dimensions that are personal to you and your journey to developing your authentic self.

**Social Wellness**

The social dimension of wellness focuses on creating meaningful connections with others, maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and being involved within the community. This dimension encourages individuals to value diversity and treat others with respect and thus create safe and inclusive spaces.

**Emotional Wellness**

The emotional dimension of wellness is an individual’s ability to understand their feelings and attitudes, control their emotions, and sustain a positive attitude towards life. Emotional wellness includes coping with stressors, practicing self-care, and being realistic with expectations. For more information visit Ch.4 Mental Health & Wellness, which covers the topics such as stress, sleep, anxiety, depression, and burnout.

**Intellectual Wellness**

The intellectual dimension of wellness refers to an individual actively participating in expanding their knowledge and skills. Individuals are also encouraged to become lifelong learners and strive to maintain curiosity throughout one’s life.

**Spiritual Wellness**

The spiritual dimension of wellness is the exploration of an individual to find meaning and purpose in one’s life. A spiritually well person participates in activities that reflect and are consistent with their beliefs and values.

**Occupational Wellness**

The occupational dimension of wellness is the ability of an individual to achieve personal fulfillment and satisfaction in their work. It also encompasses additional work, such as volunteering, that utilizes an individual’s skills and talents, that can positively contribute to communities they live in and society.

**Financial Wellness**

The financial dimension of wellness involves an individual relationship with money. It is the ability to effectively manage finances, spending within one’s means, and having access to the information necessary to make smart financial decisions. The underlying concept of this dimension of wellness is setting realistic goals to achieve financial security. 

**Environmental Wellness**

The environmental dimension of wellness refers to an individual’s relationship to their surroundings. It focuses on finding a harmonious relationship with the earth by understanding we as humans have the responsibility to protect the environment, which in turn affects our health and well-being. The fundamental principles are demonstrating respect to nature and living species and a commitment to a healthy planet.

# 3 - Building Healthy Habits
Habits are a key component to influence our health, wellness, and overall quality of life.

A **habit** can be defined as a recurring behavior that is triggered by a specific context and requires less conscious thought and repetition to make it happen.

**How Long Does It Take to Build a New Habit?**

 A study by a health psychology researcher at the University College London examined the habits of 82 people over a 12-week period. The findings reported on average it took more than two months for a new behavior to become automatic – 66 days to be more specific. However, the time frame can depend widely on the behavior, the person, and the situation. Interestingly, the results concluded the range for people to form a new habit was 18 days to 254 days.
