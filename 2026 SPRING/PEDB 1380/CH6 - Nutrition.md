# Intro
**Nutrition can be defined as the science of food and how the body uses it in health and disease.**

**Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  
1. Identify the six essential nutrients needed to fuel the body.  
2. Describe and apply the Dietary Guidelines and MyPlate recommendations into your daily life.  
3. Calculate your daily caloric intake when participating in physical activity.  
4. Create and prepare a plan to eat on a healthy budget.

# 1 - Nutrition Basics

The body needs food for fuel and the type of food consumed does make a difference not only in performance but also in avoiding diet-related diseases, such as heart disease and certain cancers. Water is also an important component as the human body is made up of 60% water and therefore individuals can only survive a few days without it. Water helps transport nutrients and waste throughout the body acts as a solvent and regulates body temperature. Both food and water are essential for the body to operate on a daily basis.

The fuel needed by the body can be categorized into **five** major nutrients:

- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Fats
- Vitamins
- Minerals

These essential nutrients are needed on a daily basis to support growth and maintain optimal health and can be categorized as macronutrients and micronutrients.

**Macronutrients** – are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that provide the body with energy.

**Micronutrients** – are vitamins and minerals which contribute to the regulation and overall wellbeing of bodily functions.

**Macronutrients  
**Macronutrients are the main suppliers of nutrients in your diet, needed in large amounts by the body for survival. The recommendation for macronutrients varies depending on age, lifestyle, gender, and objectives. Macronutrients can be further categorized into three: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. An outline of each is provided below.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Nutrient**|**Types**|
|**Carbohydrates**<br><br>- The preferred fuel for the body.<br>- 45-65% of total daily calories.|**1. Complex Carbohydrates**   <br>Have the potential to be stored in the body to be used at a later time. Starch, glycogen, and fiber are examples.  <br>**2. Simple Carbohydrates**  <br>Lack fiber and contain mostly sugar.|
|**Proteins**<br><br>- The main structural material in the body. It is needed for the growth and repair of all cells.<br>- 10-35% of total daily calories.|**1. Complete Proteins**  <br>Contain all 9 essential amino acids (mostly animal products).  <br>**2. Incomplete Proteins**  <br>Lack at least one essential amino acid (mostly plant-based foods).|
|**Fats**<br><br>- The most “energy-rich” nutrient.<br>- Readily stored in adipose tissue.<br>- 20-35% of total daily calories.|**1. Saturated Fats**  <br>Mostly found in animal products. Try to limit to less than 10% of daily calories.  <br>**2. Unsaturated Fats**  <br>Found in plant-based products. They are liquid at room temperature.  <br>**3. Trans Fat**  <br>Chemically altered fat, which is often added to foods, fried, and processed.|

**Micronutrients**  
Micronutrients are essential to maintain good health in an individual, however, they are only needed in small quantities. Micronutrients play an important role in the production of hormones and enzymes, as well as human development. Therefore, young children and older adults, in particular, should consume enough micronutrients. Micronutrients can be further categorized into two: vitamins and minerals.

| **Nutrient**                                                                                                                                                                          | **Types**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     |
| **Vitamins** <br><br>- Organic compounds that provide no direct energy.<br>- They enable chemical reactions to occur in the body.                                                     | **1. Fat-Soluble Vitamins**: A, D & E  <br>They require fat to be absorbed and are not easily excreted. Can be stored in the body.  <br>**2. Water Soluble Vitamins**: B & C  <br>They do not require fat to be absorbed and are easily secreted. Tend to be less toxic than the fat-soluble vitamins. |     |
| **Minerals**<br><br>- Inorganic compounds that provide no direct energy.<br>- They play a critical role in the nervous system functioning other cellular processes and water balance. | **1. Major Minerals**  <br>Are needed in large amounts: >100 milligrams per day. Include calcium, phosphorous, sodium, and potassium.  <br>**2. Trace Minerals**  <br>Daily requirements are less than 100 milligrams: copper, fluoride, iodide, iron, and zine.                                       |     |

# 2 - Dietary Guidelines

Based on scientific evidence, the Dietary Guidelines provide current health recommendations for children and adults of all ages, including those who are healthy, those at risk for diet-related diseases, and those living with diseases. The guidelines emphasize that a healthy diet pattern is not a rigid prescription, instead, it is a personalized framework that caters to your individual preferences. 

In the most recent edition, _Make Every Bite Count with the Dietary Guidelines – 2020-2025_ there are four overarching guidelines:

1. Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage. 
2. Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.
3. Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits. 
4. Limit food and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. 

To find out more information on each of the guidelines, visit the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans Report.](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf)

# 3 - MyPlate

We just looked at the essential nutrients (macronutrients and micronutrients) needed to maintain optimal health, but how else can we know what a healthy plate looks like? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers MyPlate as a framework that includes tips, ideas, and recommendations to create a healthy eating style. No matter what your individual needs may be, MyPlate can help find the right balance for you by including the five food groups:
1. fruits, 
2. vegetables, 
3. grains,
4. protein, and 
5. dairy.

For more information on each of the food groups click the [MyPlate.](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/)

Additionally, take note of the following tips MyPlate suggests in order to sustain a healthy eating style.

- **Focus on all food and beverage choices, each decision matters.  
    **Variety is the key. Include different types of fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy products when planning or preparing meals.
- **Reduce your intake of saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars.  
    **Use nutrition labels and ingredient lists to find the amount of saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars in your meals.
- **Take it one step at a time and do not try to make big changes straight away.  
    **Start with small changes and progress from there. For example, adding more vegetables into your meals or changing to low-fat dairy products.
- **Provide support and healthy choices for those around you.  
    **Creating an environment of healthy choices for you and others around you will help make your journey to a healthy eating style easier and more enjoyable.


# 4 - Caloric Intake

We have looked at what to put in our bodies and the guidelines to follow in order to find the right balance of nutrients, but what about how much food you should be consuming?

We may sometimes find ourselves peaking at the back of food packages, glaring at the numbers found next to food items on menus, and even using Google to see how many calories are in the foods we choose to eat. However, understanding the daily recommendations for calories combined with the amount of physical activity is essential to balancing a healthy lifestyle.

**What is a Calorie?  
**Surprising to many, a **calorie is a unit that is used to measure energy.** A calorie found in food is actually a kilocalorie (kcal). These particular calories provide energy in the form of heat so that our bodies can function. While calories are essential to our daily lives, it is important to monitor the appropriate number of calories one intakes. According to the American Heart Association, 2,000 (kcals) is an ideal amount of calories to consume per day. However, you may need to consume less or more than 2,000 calories depending upon your age, gender, activity level, and whether you’re trying to lose, gain or maintain your weight.

Now it’s your turn: Identify your ideal daily caloric intake, click the link provided by the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/take-control-your-weight/calorie-counter-calculator.html).

In order to balance caloric intake versus output, you can partake in various activities to burn calories. For example, did you know that:

- Dancing for an hour can burn around 370 calories
- Mowing the lawn (using a non-riding mower) burns approximately 324 calories
- An hour of cleaning can burn about 240 calories

See the link for more examples of [how to burn calories](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/get-active/exercise-counts-calculator.html) in various ways.


# 5 - Fast Food Choices

As a student, you might be busy throughout the day and preoccupied with assignments and tests to plan and prepare healthy meals. You may have experienced a time where you have got home late from work or have too much homework and not enough time to cook, and often resorted to fast food restaurants. While it’s understandable that there are times where a fast-food chain is inevitable, it is important to know there are still ways to eat healthily.

Whether your favorite restaurant is Chick-Fil-A or Taco Bell, Fast Food Nutrition has provided an interactive tool that allows you to assess the nutritional value of items at fast-food restaurants. Click [HERE](https://fastfoodnutrition.org/fast-food-meal-calculator) to access the tool and enjoy searching through some of your favorite fast-food menus.


# 6 - Eating Healthy on a Budget

As a student, learning to budget can be challenging at times. When you think about textbooks, living expenses, transportation, and having a social life, it seems like your funds could be stretched thin. In addition to this, being able to afford the healthier options at the grocery store can also become a difficult task. This often leads to buying affordable foods or opting for a fast-food restaurant. However, with just a few smart strategies, eating healthy on a budget can be achieved.

- **Make a Weekly Game Plan  
    **Before planning out a grocery list, decide what meals you want to make for the week. This will help you know what ingredients you need to buy and ensure you’re getting nutritious and balanced meals for the week.  
    If you’re in need of some inspiration for some recipes to try check out the [MyPlate Kitchen](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/myplatekitchen).
- **Create a Grocery List**  
    Once you have your game plan for the week, preparing a grocery list is essential to staying organized and avoiding spending extra money on foods you don’t necessarily need. A great tip is to organize your list into the different food groups to make your trip to the grocery store as efficient as possible.
- **Know the Budget-Friendly Options from Each Food Group**  
    From buying “in season” produce to low-cost protein foods, each aisle in the grocery store has budget-friendly options for you to consider.  
    Check out the link from [MyPlate](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/budget/tips-for-every-aisle) which offers you low-cost options for every aisle and food group.
- **Understand and Compare Unit Prices**  
    Knowing what the unit price means and comparing it to other options is the best method for eating healthy on a college student budget. Although you may think the smaller packages are giving you the best value for money, when you start comparing unit prices, you may soon realize that the larger packages could be the cheaper option.  
    Check out the [MyPlate link](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/budget/budget-price-tag) which provides a breakdown of understanding the price tag of what is on a grocery shelf:
- **Take Advantage of Coupons**  
    Take the time to look for special offers and coupons at your local grocery store. Deals are always out there, with flyers, online, and even apps nowadays, be on the lookout. You never know how much you might save.
