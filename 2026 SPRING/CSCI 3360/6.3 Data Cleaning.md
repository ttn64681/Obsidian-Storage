# Review
- Stopped at Data cleaning

-  Data Munging
	- converting unorganized/unstructured data to structured
	- no scientific method
- Handling Missing Data
	- Strategies: 
		- dropping records
		- using global constant to fill up
		- imputation, etc.

- This time, continue Data Cleaning process

# Intro
## Smooth Noisy Data
- data my be corrupted/inconsistent or noise present
- Strategies:
	- Removing outliers
	- resolve inconsistencies systematically

- Sometimes, outliers are important:
	- identifying RARE occurrences
	- and you want to learn the outlier 'patterns'

	- in data mining tasks, it is important
	- for normal data analysis, its not important

# Data Pre-Processing
- Cleaning
- Integration
- Transformation
- Reduction

## Data Integration
- only relevant for multiple data sources
- combines data from multiple sources into a coherent storage place (e.g., a single file or a database)
- schema integration, e.g., A.cust_id and B.cust_number
- Combining of metadata from diff sources

- **Detect and resolve data value conflicts**
	- diff representations or different scales/metrics
- **Address redundant data in data integration**
	- *Redundant data is commonly generated in the process of integrating multiple databases*
		- Same attribute with different names in different databases
		- "Derived" attributes
	- **Correlation analysis may detect instances of redundant data**


## Data Transformation
- Generalization
- f
- f
- f

### Generalization
- Concept hierarchy climbing
	- A way to organize concepts defined in a knowledge domain
	- Multilevel organization of concepts
- **Ex: categorical variables**
