# Intro
- a recursive proces
- more time spent thinking than doing

# Epicycles of Analysis
1. Stating the Question
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Building
	- goes hand-in-hand w/ interpretation
4. Interpret
5. Communicate

# 6 Types of Questions
**Data Questions**
1. Descriptive
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

## 1. Descriptive
- Seeks to summarize characteristic of a set of data
- Ex:
	- proportion of males
	- mean num of servings of fresh fruits per day
	- frequency of viral illness in a set of data
- NO interpretation of result itself
## 2. Exploratory
- Analyzes data to see if patterns, trends, or relationships exist
- Often called **"hypothesis-generating" analyses**
- Looking for patterns to support proposing a hypothesis
- Ex:
	- *you find that:* individuals who ate a diet high in certain foods had fewer viral illnesses than..
	- *So, you propose hypothesis:* "Among adults, eating 5 servings is associated w/ fewer viral illnesses that year"
## 3. Inferential
- Restatement of a proposed hypothesis as a question
- Answered by analyzing a diff set of data
- Determines if an association holds in a representative sample
- Infers what is true, on average, for a population
## 4. Predictive
- Asks what types of things predict an outcome
- Less interested in what causes the outcome
- Focuses purely on what predicts the behavior or outcome
- Ex:
	- "What is possibility of x happening in future?"
## 5. Causal
- Asks whether changing one factor changes another factor
- Focuses on avg change in a population
- Often utilizes data collected in a randomized trial
- Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection allows for the question to be causal
## 6. Mechanistic
- Asks exactly how a factor leads to an outcome
- Explains the underlying mechanism
- Not the cause, but the process

# Epicycles of Question Formulation
- Establishing expectation about question

# 5 Characteristics of Good Questions
1. Of Interest

## 1. Of Interest
- Of interest to audience
- Audience depends on context and environment

## 2. Not Already Answered

## 3. Plausible Framework
- ensure grounding by using subject area knowledge and research
## 4. Answerable

## 5. Specificity
- refines plan of attack
 - directly informs what steps to take when looking at data
- leads to more interpretable answer at end of analysis


# Translating a Question into Data Analysis

## Pitfalls: Inappropriate Data
- Scenario:
## Pitfalls: Confounding Variable
- External factor that influences both the observed "cause" and "effect", making it seem like there's a direct relationship where there isn't, or masking a true relationship
- **Ex:** 
	- If you observe that people who drink more coffee also live longer, you might think coffee causes longer life. 
	- However, if coffee drinkers tend to also exercise more (the confounder), it might be the exercise, not the coffee, that's contributing to longevity.

## Pitfalls: Biased Data Collection
- Recall bias:
	- occurs when remembering past events differently when a health condition is present
- Selection bias:
	- occurs when data collection inflates the proportion of people w/ both characteristics
- Biased underlying data collection leads to uninterpretable results

## Pitfalls: 


# Case study:
- Which demographic and health characteristics identify users who are most likely to have chronic drowsiness, defined as at least one episode of drowsiness at least every other day?
