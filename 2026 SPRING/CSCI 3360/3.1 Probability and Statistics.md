# Model Uncertainty
## Deterministic vs Stochastic Systems
**Deterministic**
- **Zero randomness; outcomes are fixed**
- Same inputs always yield the same output
- 100% predictable if initial conditions known
- Simple, rigid and efficient
**Stochastic**
- **Inherent randomness or uncertainty**
- Same inputs yield a distribution of possible outcomes
- Only probabilistic predictions
	- (e.g., averages or likelihoods)
- Complex, statistical frameworks

## Model Uncertainty
- In deterministic systems, uncertainty is a practical limitation
	- e.g. position of object given initial velocity and position
- **In stochastic systems, uncertainty is a built-in feature of reality**
	- e.g. population of country in 5 yrs

# Statistical Learning
![[statistical learning models ex.png]]
- X - independent variables (predictors)
- Y - dependent variables (response)

- We assume there is some relationship b/w Y and X = (X1,X2,...,Xp), which can be written in the general form
	- **Y = f(X) + ε**
		- f(X) - estimation function given input X
		- ε - error term
- In essence statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f

## Why estimate f?
- in many situations, a set of inputs X are available, but output Y cannot be easily obtained
	- ^Y = ^f(X)
	- **(Predicted response) = (estimation function given X)**
- Reducible and irreducible error
	- Reducible - error due to imperfections of model
		- you can reduce error by choosing better model, improving estimation technique, or getting better/more data
	- Irreducible - error that cannot be eliminated no matter what.
		- comes from noise or randomness (ε) in data itself
		- even with the true f(X), can't predict Y perfectly

# Probability
- The uncertain phenomenon of interest
- P(event) = times event occurs / total repetitions

- given sample space **Omega**, let C be collection of events, a probability measure P is a function, which maps events in C to a number b/w 0 and 1, satisfying the following axioms:
	- All probabilities are nonnegative, P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A in C
	- Probability of sample space is one, P(**Omega**) = 1
	- If events A1, A2, ... , An in C are disjoint, then prob of their union equals sum of their indiv probabilities

## Random Var
- a measurable fn X:Omega -> E mapping the sample space to a measurable space
- *function that maps an outcome from the sample space (`w`) to a real number.*
	- Consider a probability space representing 2 rolls of a 6-sided die
	- Each possible outcome can be encoded as a vector w/ 2 entries
```
w:= [w1],      w1,w2 in {1,2,3,4,5,6}
    [w2]
    
w1 = outcome 1st roll
w2 = outcome 2nd rolls
```
1. Modeling result of first roll:
	- ~a(w) := w1
		- ~a - random var that maps sample space to real number
		- this function seems to give the result of the first roll
	- the range of ~a is {1,2,3,4,5,6}
```
For ~a = 1:
	{w:~a(w) = 1} := {[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[1]}
					 {[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]}
```

# Calculating diff types of Random Vars
## Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- **Meaning:** For **discrete** random variables (like a die roll, where outcomes are distinct, countable numbers), the <span style="background:#fff88f">PMF gives the exact probability for each possible outcome.</span>
- **Point:** It allows you to visualize and calculate the likelihood of _each specific value_ a discrete random variable can take. For your `~a` (first roll of a die), the PMF would state P(`~a` =1) = 1/6, P(`~a` =2) = 1/6, etc.

- if the ~a is a discrete variable, a mathematical function to map the probability of ai,
	- p_~a (ai) = P(~a=ai)
- Properties:
	- o ≤ p_~a (ai) ≤ 1
	- Σp_~a (ai) = 1
![[PMF.png]]

## Probability Density Function (PDF)
- **Meaning:** For **continuous** random variables (e.g., height, temperature, time), the PDF describes the _relative likelihood_ for a random variable to take on a given value. You cannot get a direct probability for a single point, but rather for a range.
- **Point:** It allows you to calculate the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a certain range (by integrating the PDF over that range).
	- DOESN'T APPLY TO DICE EXAMPLE

- if the ~a is a continuous var, the function maps probability density
	- P(a-ε ≤ ~a ≤ a) = Integral_a-ε to a [f_~a(ai)]
![[PDF.png]]

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- **Meaning:** For both discrete and continuous random variables, the CDF gives the cumulative probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a certain value `a`.
- **Point:** It provides a complete picture of the probability distribution, showing the probability of getting _up to_ a certain value. For your `~a`, F_`~a`(3) would be P(`~a` ≤ 3) = P(`~a`=1) + P(`~a`=2) + P(`~a`=3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

- the function to map the probability of ~a ≤ a
	- F_~a(a) := P(~a ≤ a)
- Consider the following CDF:
![[CDF.png]]

## Expected Value
- **Point:** It represents the **long-run average** or mean of a random variable. If you were to repeat the experiment many times, the expected value is what you'd expect the average outcome to be. For a single 6-sided die roll, E[X] = (1*1/6) + (2*1/6) + ... + (6*1/6) = 3.5.

- Weighted Average where each possible outcome is multiplied by its probability
	- Discrete variable: E[X] = SUM xi \* P(xi)
	- Continuous variable: E[X] = Integral_-INF to INF [ x \* f(x) dx]

# Characterizing Distributions
## Moments
- quantitative measures that describe the **shape and characteristics of a probability distribution** (or a set of data points).
- Different moments reveal different properties of the distribution.

- The n-th moment of a random variable is the expected value of its n-th power.
	- Let X be a random var and n in N
	- if μ_x (n) = E[X^n] exists and finite, this is n-th **moment** of X
		- 
	- 𝜇̄_x (n) = E[(X - E[X])^n] is the n-th **central moment**
		- this is the spread or deviation from avg expected value
		- This is the expected value of the _deviation of X from its mean_ (E[X]), raised to the power of `n`.

## First Moment
- Mean μ
- Measures central tendency
- Highly sensitive to outliers

## Second Moment
-  Variance sigma^2
- Measures the dispersion from mean μ
- Var(X) = E[(X -μ)^2]
	- μ is E[X]

## Third Moment
- Skewness gamma_1
- Measures the asymmetry
- gamma_1 = E[ (x-μ)^3 / sigma]
- Figure:
	- left-skewed (negative)
		- tells how flat the tail is
![[Left skew.png]]
## Fourth Moment
- Kurtosis K
- Measures the "tailedness"
- K = E[ (X-μ)^4 / sigma]
![[Kurtosis.png]]
