## What is it?
- field using scientific methods, algs, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data
- combines:
	- Stats and Maths
	- Comp Sci
	- Domain Expertise

## Data Science vs Others
- DS vs Stats
	- Stats deals w/ data collection, analysis, interpretation, etc.
	- involves surveying
- DS vs ML
	- subset of Artificial Intelligence using stats techbiques to enable machines to improve w/ exp
	- creating algorithms
- DS vs Deep Learning
	- subfield of machine learning using algorithms inspired by structure and function of brain's neural networks



# **What Makes a Machine "Learn"?**

- A machine "learns" by **identifying patterns in data** and **improving its ability to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for every scenario**. This learning process helps machines to make accurate predictions or decisions based on the information they receive. 
- Unlike traditional programming where instructions are fixed, ML allows models to adapt and improve through experience.


## How a Machine Learns...

1. ****Data Input:**** 
	1. Machine needs data like text, images or numbers to analyze. Good quality and enough quantity of data are important for effective learning.
2. ****Algorithms:**** 
	1. Algorithms are mathematical methods that help the machine find patterns in data. Different algorithms help different tasks such as classification or regression.
3. ****Model Training:**** 
	1. During training, the machine adjusts its internal settings to better predict outcomes. It learns by reducing the difference between its predictions and actual results.
4. ****Feedback Loop:**** 
	1. Machine compares its predictions with true outcomes and uses this feedback to correct errors. Techniques like [gradient descen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/gradient-descent-algorithm-and-its-variants/) t help it update and improve.
5. ****Experience and Iteration:**** 
	1. Machine repeats training many times with data helps in refining its predictions with each pass, more data and iterations improve accuracy.
6. ****Evaluation and Generalization:**** 
	1. Model is tested on unseen data to ensure it performs well on real-world tasks.
