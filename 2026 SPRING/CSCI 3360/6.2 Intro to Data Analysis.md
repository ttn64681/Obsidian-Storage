# Intro
1. The Question!

- <span style="background:#fff88f">What is the main component of Data Analysis???</span>
## Questions
- **Descriptive:** *(1 feature)*
	- What is mean body mass
	- What is most prevalent gender
	- What is most common bill length
- **Exploratory:** *exploring relation between 2+ features*
	- Which species has highest body mass?
	- Is there a correlation b/w flipper length and body mass?
	- Is mean bill length of species larger than another species?
- **Inferential:** 
	- is bill length related to gender
- **Predictive**:
	- does larger body mass = larger bill length?
	- do males avg longer bill lengths than female penguins?
- **Causal:**
	- Is body mass affected by size of bill?
- **Mechanistic:**
	- Why is body mass proportional to size/depth of bill?

## What is Main Component of Data Analysis?
- <span style="background:#fff88f">DATA is the most important thing.</span>
	- without it, you cannot move forward

- Factors:
	- **Quality**:

# Data Types
- **Structured**
	- highly organized
	- can be seamlessly included in a database
	- readily searched via simple search ops
- **Unstructured**
	- devoid of any underlying structure

- **Record**
	- Data Matrix
	- Document-term Data
	- Transaction Data
- **Graph-based**
	- Relationships among objects
	- Objects that are graphs
- **Ordered**

- *In most cases, data is unstructured, and you must structure it*
	- **Data Pre-Processing**

## Structured Data
- csv, json, 

## Unstructured Data

### Challenges w/ Unstructured Data
- Compilation + Organizing it is time/energy-consuming
- Structured data is akin to Machine Language, in that:
	- it makes info much easier to be parsed by computers
- Unstructured data is often how "humans communicate" (natural language)
	- NLP's (nat lang processors)

## Record Data
- Data that consists of collection of records, each of which consists of fixed set of attributes
	- Usually stored either in flat files or in relational databases
	- Basic form of record data does not have explicit relationship among records or attributes, every record has same set of attributes

- Data Matrix:
	- Data set represented by an m by n matrix, where there are m rows, one for each object, and n cols, one for each attributes

- Document-term Data
	- Each doc becomes a 'term' vector
	- Each term is component (attribute) of the vector
	- The val of each component is the num of times the corresponding term occurs in doc

- Transaction Data:
	- A special type of record data
	- Each transaction involves a set of items
	- Can represent transaction data as record data

## Graph Data
- relationships among data
- objects that are graphs
- ex:
	- parent-child relationships:
		- web-based links / user web-history/activity

## Ordered Data
- **Sequential transaction data**
	- an extension of transaction data
	- each transaction has a time associated w/ it

| Time | Customer | Items Purchased |
| ---- | -------- | --------------- |
| t1   | C1       | ...             |
| t2   | C2       |                 |
| t2   | C3       |                 |
| t3   | C4       |                 |
| t4   | C5       |                 |
| t5   | C6       |                 |

- **Sequence data**

- **Temporal data**
	- each record is a time series

- Spatio-Temporal data
	- Have spatial attributes, such as positions or areas, in addition to other types of attributes
	- Often such measurements are collected over time, and thus, the data consists of time series at various locations

## Handling non-record data
- most algs are for record data or its variations, like transactions and matrix data
- for non-record data, 


## Data Storage and Presentation
- CSV (Comma,Separated Values)
	- standard, more generic, and useful to read and machine to interpret
	- **no specialized tools needed to read or manipulate**
		- can use excel, word, sheets, works most of time
	- using "comma" prohibits having "comma" in data format

- TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
	- **used for raw data and can be imported into and exported from spreadsheet software**
	- files are raw
	- not as human-readable
	- ...

- XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
	- **Designed to be both human- and machine-readable**
	- Data is stored in plain text format, it provides a software- and hardware- independent way of storing data
	- Easier to create data that can be shared by different applications

- RSS (Really Simple Syndication)
	- *Used to share data b/w services*
	- Format of RSS follows XML standard usage, defines the names of specific tags
	- *RSS data is small and fast loading*
	- ex:
		- want to get updates from news article page:
			- every update sends RSS feed (info from website)
			- can capture RSS feed and read it
		- when you get tweet:
			- you get notification from ...

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
	- *A lightweight data-interchange format*
	- **Easy for humans to read and write**
	- **Easy for machines to parse and generate**

# Data Pre-processing
1. Cleaning
2. Integration
3. Transformation
4. Reduction


- Data in real world is often dirt or unorganized
- Indicators of dirtiness:
	- Incomplete
	- Noisy
	- Inconsistent (different metrics/units)

## Data Cleaning
- **Data Munging**
	- Convert unorganized/unstructured data to more convenient or desirable format (structured)
	- No specific one rule, No specific scientific method available
	- Done manually, automatically, or in many cases, semi-automatically
- Ex: "Add 2 dices tomatoes, three cloves of garlic, and a pinch of salt in the mix"
	- ???How would this be done automatically?

- **Handling Missing Data**
	- Due to various reasons
		  Faculty data collection
		  System or human error while storing or transferring
	- Strategies: (active research area)
		- ignoring records (dropping)
		- using global constant to fill up
		- Imputation

- **Smooth Noisy Data**
	- Data may be corrupted (inconsistent) or noise present
	- Strategies:
		- Removing outliers
		- Resolve inconsistencies systematically
## Data Collections
- Open Data
	- Public, 
	- Accessible, 
	- Described, 
	- Reusable, 
	- Complete, 
	- Timely, 
	- Managed 
	- post-release
- Examples of Sources (Open Data)
	- Data.gov, 
		- Gov
	- HHS Open Data
		- Health
	- openBIGdata.org
	- Datasets at the Library of Congress
	- Kaggle
		- diff versions of Open Datasets and research/analysis

	- MIMIC 
		- dataset for medical patient data
		- MIMIC v3
		- MIMIC v4
			- constantly updated/maintained

- Social Media Data
	- API provided by the companies to researchers and developers
	- goldmine for collecting data to analyze for research or marketing purposes
